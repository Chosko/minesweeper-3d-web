name: runbook-describe
version: 0.3.5
type: command
description: Print a compact summary of one runbook — its index line, header, and one line per step with marker, title, dependencies and who it needs — without opening a step prompt. Use it to see where a runbook stands.
requires: skill:runbook-run

# /runbook-describe
# Global command: print a compact summary of one runbook — heading, one header
# line, one line per step with an optional one-line done: summary, and a
# closing count. Read-only — never modifies any file. Reads the index and
# extracts lines from exactly one body, at its index block's `File:` path —
# never a full read of the body, never a step prompt, never a task body,
# never another runbook. Task ids in a `Done:` line are printed as written
# and never followed. Runs no shell command including git, and corrects no
# status, count or marker however wrong it looks against the body.
# Usage: /runbook-describe <id|name|id-name>
# Examples: /runbook-describe implement-ecc-import
#           /runbook-describe 3
#           /runbook-describe 3-implement-ecc-import

GOAL
Answer what `/runbook-list` deliberately cannot: **what are this runbook's
steps, and how did the finished ones go?** Give one line per step and a
one-line record per finished step — nothing like the body itself. A reader who
needs the prompts, the `Context:` notes or the full `Done:` record opens the
file.

- This is a diagnostic / orientation command. Write, edit, create or commit
  nothing, and run no shell command of any kind, `git` included.
- Never add, edit or persist a line in a body or in the index: authoring lines
  are `/runbook-create`'s, the run's lines are `/runbook-run`'s.
- Never run, resume, append to or delete a runbook — those are `/runbook-run`,
  `/runbook-create --append` and `/runbook-clean`.

$ARGUMENTS

THE ARTIFACT

- The store, the body schema, the five step markers, the `Done:` line, the
  `Needs:` field, the four-status vocabulary, the index block and the id are
  all specified in `../skills/runbook-run/references/runbook-schema.md`.
- Read it before parsing either file. Nothing about the artifact is restated
  here.

WORKFLOW

1. Read `.claude/RUNBOOKS.md` and resolve the argument to one block, per
   RESOLVING THE ARGUMENT.

2. Extract the body lines named in THE READ BUDGET from the block's `File:`
   path, and attach each to its step.

3. Render exactly this shape, and nothing more:

   ```
   3. implement-ecc-import   [RUNNING]   4/7   —   Land the ECC import architecture
      Created: 2026-09-01   Source: /architect ecc-import   Model: sonnet

      [x] 1. Add the requires: field to the frontmatter contract
             done: a1b2c3d — added the field and its cmd-add resolution (+1 wrong premise)
      [!] 2. Wire cmd-rm's dependents guard            deps: 1
             done: FAILED — <first clause of the reason>
      [ ] 3. Update the authoring guide                 deps: 1, 2   needs: agent+human

      7 steps: 4 done, 1 failed, 2 pending.
      Step 3 needs a person present.
   ```

   **The heading line.** Id, name, status, progress and title, from the index.
   - For a `[FAILED]` runbook, and only for one, follow it with the index's
     `Failed at:` line as a continuation, exactly as `/runbook-list` renders
     it.
   - A block carrying a `Parked:` line gets that continuation the same way,
     `↳ parked: steps <ids>`, after the `Failed at:` one when both are present.

   **The header line.** One line: `Created:`, `Source:`, `Model:`. Nothing
   else from the header on this line — no `Sequencing:`, no `Companion:`, no
   `Last step number:` — and no count of `## Do not re-propose` items or its
   contents. The only other header field ever printed, `Archive:`, gets its
   own line below.

   **The archived-ids line.** Print it **only when the body carries an
   `Archive:` line**, directly under the header line, above the step list so
   the step list is never read as the whole runbook: the ids as the body holds
   them, ascending, followed by a short parenthetical saying they were pruned
   and count as done:

   ```
   3. implement-ecc-import   [PENDING]   3/5   —   Land the ECC import architecture
      Created: 2026-09-01   Source: /architect ecc-import   Model: sonnet
      Archived: 1, 2, 3   (pruned; counted as done)

      [!] 4. Wire cmd-rm's dependents guard            deps: 1
             done: FAILED — <first clause of the reason>
      [ ] 6. Update the authoring guide                deps: 1, 2

      5 steps: 3 done, 1 failed, 1 pending.
   ```

   - A runbook never pruned renders **exactly as it does otherwise, line for
     line**: no `Archived:` line, no empty placeholder, no changed count.
     That is the common case — `Archive:` is absent on every runbook never
     pruned and is never written empty.
   - A body whose every step has been pruned is legal, not malformed. Render
     its heading, its header line, its `Archived:` line and its count
     (`7 steps: 7 done.`) and nothing between them. Do not report it as an
     error, and do not render an empty step list with no explanation.

   **The step lines.** One line per step, in body order:
   - The marker **as the body carries it** — `[ ]`, `[~]`, `[x]`, `[!]`,
     `[P]` — first on the line, then the number and the title. A `[P]` step
     prints its marker and nothing of its `Context:`.
   - `deps:` on the same line, only when the step has dependencies. A step
     whose `Depends on:` is `none` prints nothing for it. Print a surviving
     `Depends on:` naming an archived id **verbatim**, like any other: do not
     annotate it, mark it satisfied, or cross-reference it against the
     `Archived:` line.
   - `needs:` on the same line, only when the step carries an authored
     `Needs:` value that is not `agent`. A step without a `Needs:` line prints
     nothing; never infer one.

   **The `done:` line.** At most one, under a step that has a `Done:` line:
   - the commit sha(s) and a short summary of what was done;
   - wrong premises only as a count, `(+N wrong premise)` or
     `(+N wrong premises)`;
   - for a `[!]` step, open with `FAILED —` and the first clause of its
     reason;
   - task ids the `Done:` line mentions, printed as written.

   No `context:` line and no `Context:` text of any kind. Never print, quote
   or summarise prompt text, in whole or in part.

   **The closing lines.**
   - One line counting the steps by marker — only the non-zero counts, the
     singular for one step, `[~]` named "in progress", `[P]` named "parked".
   - **Count every id on the `Archive:` line as done and as present**, per
     `runbook-schema.md` § *An archived id counts as `[x]`* and the index's
     `Steps:` accounting one level down: the total is the steps present plus
     the archived ids; the done count is the present `[x]` steps plus the same
     archived ids. This keeps the count agreeing with the progress figure in
     the heading line.
   - When any step has an authored `Needs:` value other than `agent`, one
     further line naming those step numbers — "Step 3 needs a person
     present." or "Steps 2 and 5 need a person present."

   **Describe; never reconcile.**
   - Never correct a status, a `Steps:` count, a marker, a `Failed at:` or a
     `Parked:` line, however wrong the index looks against the lines just
     extracted. Reconciliation belongs to `/runbook-run`. Reporting an
     inconsistency in prose is fine; editing it is not.
   - Deriving the closing count from the body's steps **and its `Archive:`
     line** is derivation, not reconciliation — it is how the count is arrived
     at every time, pruned runbook or not. An index `Steps:` count that
     disagrees with the derived one is reported in prose and never corrected.
   - Do not suggest next actions, recommend whether to resume the runbook, or
     comment on how long it has been `[RUNNING]`. The user decides.

RESOLVING THE ARGUMENT

`$ARGUMENTS`, trimmed, names one runbook — as `<id>`, `<name>` or
`<id>-<name>`. Resolve it to exactly one index block by `runbook-schema.md`
§ *Resolving a runbook argument*, whose checks, errors and ambiguity report are
not restated here.

- **No argument** — print the usage line and stop. Do not pick a runbook, do
  not default to the most recent, and do not fall back to listing them all;
  that is `/runbook-list`.
- **An argument that does not resolve** — unknown, a compound whose halves
  disagree, or an ambiguity — report it as the schema says, list the runbooks
  that do exist (id, status and name, from the index) as the error's
  supporting detail, and stop. Never guess at a near match, and never fall
  back from one half of an argument to the other.
- **A missing or empty `.claude/RUNBOOKS.md`** — not an error. One line and
  stop:

  > No runbooks in this project — `/runbook-create` authors one.

  Do not create the file and do not suggest a setup command; runbooks need no
  setup step.
- **An index block whose `File:` path does not resolve** — print the block's
  fields, then say plainly that the body is missing at that path. Do not error
  out, do not create anything, and do not correct the index.

---

THE READ BUDGET

Read `.claude/RUNBOOKS.md` for the runbook's index block. From the body at
that block's `File:` path, pull **only the lines the command prints**, by
targeted line extraction with the Grep tool (with line numbers) — never a full
Read of the body:

- the header fields `Created:`, `Source:`, `Model:` and `Archive:`;
- the step headings — `##` lines carrying a marker and a number;
- each step's `Depends on:` and `Needs:` lines;
- the first line of each step's `Done:`;
- the fence lines of the ```prompt``` blocks, used only to discard any match
  that falls inside a prompt block. Nothing between the fences is read or
  printed.

Rules for the extraction:

- Attach each field to the nearest preceding step heading. The
  `## Do not re-propose` heading is not a step; do not read its contents.
- `Archive:` is optional and usually absent — its absence is the common case,
  not a malformed body. Extract it when present as one more field of the same
  Grep over the same body (no extra pass); print nothing for it when absent.
- Report a body whose extracted lines do not fit the schema — a step with no
  `Depends on:`, a heading without a number — **as found**, in one line of
  prose. Never compensate by reading more of the body.
- The Grep tool is not a shell command, so this still runs no shell.

The bound is the whole point of the command, so it is absolute:

- never a full Read of the body, and never the text of a ```prompt``` block;
- never a second runbook body, and never a walk of `.claude/runbooks/`;
- never a file under `.claude/tasks/`, the archive included — a task id in a
  `Done:` line is printed as written and never resolved;
- never `.claude/domain/`, `.claude/context/`, or any source file.
