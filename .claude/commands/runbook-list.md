# /runbook-list
# Global command: print the project's runbooks as a compact listing — id,
# status, name, progress, provenance and one-line title — optionally filtered
# by status. Read-only — never modifies any file. Reads
# `.claude/RUNBOOKS.md`, and nothing else; the runbook bodies under
# `.claude/runbooks/` are NOT opened by this command. Runs no shell command
# and corrects no status however wrong it looks. The status filter is
# matched without brackets and case-insensitively; an unknown status names
# the valid ones. A failed runbook's halt reason and a runbook's parked steps
# each print as a continuation line; a block written before ids prints `-` in
# the id column and is left alone. A missing or empty index is not an error.
# Usage: /runbook-list
#        /runbook-list <STATUS>
# Examples: /runbook-list
#           /runbook-list running
#           /runbook-list FAILED

GOAL
Show the user a scannable view of every runbook in the project: how to refer
to it, what it is, how far it got, when it was authored, where it came from,
why it halted when it did, and which steps are parked when it is waiting on an
answer. This is a diagnostic / orientation command.

One pass: read `.claude/RUNBOOKS.md`, parse each block, apply the optional
status filter, print. That is the whole command.

$ARGUMENTS

---

WORKFLOW

1. Read `.claude/RUNBOOKS.md`.
   - If it does not exist, or holds no blocks, that is **not an error**. Print
     one line and stop:

     > No runbooks in this project — `/runbook-create` authors one.

   - Do not create the file, do not offer to, do not suggest running a setup
     command (runbooks need no setup step), and say nothing about
     `.claude/runbooks/` being absent.

2. Parse every block in the file, in the order they appear, per
   `runbook-schema.md` § *The index block* (see THE ARTIFACT):
   - From the heading: the runbook's id, name and one-line title.
   - Then `Status:`, `Created:`, `Source:`, `Steps:`, and the `Failed at:`
     and `Parked:` lines where present.
   - Parse `File:` but do not print it — the listing prints the name, which
     names the body file.

3. Apply the filter from THE STATUS FILTER below, if one was given.

4. Render the output as a single compact block, **inside one fenced code
   block** so the alignment survives markdown rendering. Print one line per
   runbook, in index order:

   ```
   <id>. [STATUS]  <name>  <done>/<total>  <created>  <source>  <title>
   ```

   - Pad every column so the next one aligns. Take the padding from the widest
     value actually present, not from a hardcoded width.
   - **id**: lead the line with it, right-aligned within its column and
     followed by a `.`, so it reads as an identifier rather than a count. A
     block with no id yet prints `-` in that column (see DO NOT on
     backfilling).
   - **One-line title**: close the line with it. It is the field that makes a
     listing answerable without opening anything — the name alone is an
     identifier, not a description.
   - Print `Steps:` **verbatim** as the index carries it.
   - For a `[FAILED]` runbook, and **only** for a `[FAILED]` runbook, print
     the halt reason as a continuation line indented under the status
     column:

     ```
     ↳ failed at step <n> — <reason>
     ```

     A `[FAILED]` block with no `Failed at:` line prints the runbook's line
     and no continuation. Do not go looking in the body for the reason.
   - For a block carrying a `Parked:` line, whatever its status, print it as
     a continuation line exactly as `Failed at:` is rendered:

     ```
     ↳ parked: steps <ids>
     ```

     A block with both lines prints both, `Failed at:` first. A block with
     neither prints no continuation. Print `↳` for nothing else.
   - Do not reorder the runbooks by status, date, or anything else. Index
     order is the order.
   - Do not truncate a long title, name, halt reason or id list. Let it
     overflow.

5. After the per-runbook lines, inside the same fenced code block, print a
   one-line summary counting the runbooks by status, lower-cased:

   ```
   3 runbooks: 1 done, 1 failed, 1 pending.
   ```

   Include only the non-zero counts. Use the singular for one runbook. When
   a filter was applied, the summary covers the filtered subset and names
   the filter instead of breaking down counts of one status:

   ```
   1 runbook shown (filter: FAILED).
   ```

6. If the filter matches zero runbooks, say so explicitly — "No runbooks
   with status `[FAILED]`." — and print no fenced block at all.

The whole rendered shape, for reference:

```
  1. [DONE]     ecc-import-landing      7/7   2026-08-24  /architect run       Land the ECC import architecture
  2. [FAILED]   cli-dependency-field    2/5   2026-08-25  manual               Add a requires: field to the CLI
     ↳ failed at step 3 — the managed clone was on the wrong channel
  5. [PENDING]  context-layer-refresh   1/3   2026-08-26  /product-design run  Rebuild the context layer
     ↳ parked: steps 2

  3 runbooks: 1 done, 1 failed, 1 pending.
```

THE STATUS FILTER

- Treat `$ARGUMENTS`, when non-empty, as a **display filter and nothing
  else** — never a selector, and never a status this command writes anywhere.
- Match it **without brackets and case-insensitively**, the convention
  `/task-list` already uses: `running`, `RUNNING` and `Running` all select
  the same runbooks. Tolerate surrounding whitespace.
- An argument that matches none of the statuses in `runbook-schema.md` must
  not produce silently empty output — that is indistinguishable from having
  no matching runbooks. Say the status is unknown and **name the valid
  ones**, taking them from that file rather than from memory, then stop
  without printing a listing.

---

NEVER OPEN A BODY

- Take everything this command prints from `.claude/RUNBOOKS.md`.
- Open **no file under `.claude/runbooks/`, on any path** — not to count
  steps, not to check a marker, not to confirm a status the index reports.
- This is `/task-list`'s discipline of never opening a file under
  `.claude/tasks/`; do not trade it away under pressure. It is why the index
  carries derived fields such as `Steps:`, `Failed at:` and `Parked:`, and it
  keeps this command's cost flat in the number of runbooks rather than in
  their size.

---

THE ARTIFACT

- Read `../skills/runbook-run/references/runbook-schema.md` before parsing
  the index. It specifies the four-status vocabulary and the shape of an
  index block — its five fields and the conditional `Failed at:` and
  `Parked:` lines.
- **Restate neither in this body**; cite that file. A listing whose idea of
  the status set has drifted from the runner's is worse than no listing.

---

DO NOT:
- Write, edit, create or commit anything, and run no shell command of any
  kind, including `git`.
- Assign an id, write a `Last runbook number:` counter, or backfill an index
  that predates ids — `runbook-schema.md` § *Backfilling an index written
  before ids* gives that to the three commands that write the index, and this
  is not one of them. An id-less block prints `-` and is left alone.
- Correct a status, a `Steps:` count, a `Failed at:` or a `Parked:` line,
  however wrong it looks against the rest of the index. `/runbook-run`
  re-reads the body every step and fixes the index from it. Reporting an
  inconsistency in prose is fine; editing it is not.
- Print a runbook's `File:` path, its step titles, its prompts, or any
  `Done:` line. None of those are in the index, and reaching for them means
  opening a body. The one-line title from the heading is in the index and
  is printed.
- Suggest next actions, recommend which runbook to resume, or comment on how
  long one has been `[RUNNING]`. Just list.
- Run, resume, append to, or delete a runbook. Those are `/runbook-run`,
  `/runbook-create --append` and `/runbook-clean`.
