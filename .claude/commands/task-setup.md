# /task-setup
# Global command: initialize the project's task backlog. Creates the
# `.claude/TASKS.md` index file, the `.claude/tasks/` directory where
# per-task body files live, and the project's test-dispatch convention
# under `.claude/external/` — two thin test-runner wrapper scripts
# (`run-affected-tests.sh`, `run-full-tests.sh`) that give the project one
# stable way to run its affected and full test suites. On a project with no
# test suite it can write `/task-implement`'s testing-policy line into
# `CLAUDE.md`. Idempotent: a re-run
# leaves existing artifacts untouched and only creates the missing ones.
# Authoring command — leaves everything uncommitted for review unless
# `--commit` is passed.
# Usage: /task-setup                     (leaves the scaffolding uncommitted)
# Usage: /task-setup --commit            (commit and push the scaffolding this run wrote)
# Usage: /task-setup --commit --no-push  (commit locally, skip the push)
# Usage: /task-setup <any of the above> --attended | --unattended

GOAL

Create the artifacts the rest of the task-* workflow assumes:
1. `.claude/TASKS.md` — the lightweight index: one summary block per task,
   plus a counter for the highest task number ever assigned.
2. `.claude/tasks/` — the directory holding each task's full body in
   `<N>.md`, one file per task ID.
3. `.claude/external/run-affected-tests.sh` — a thin wrapper that runs the
   project's test runner against the test files passed on the command line.
   Inferred from project files at `/task-setup` time.
4. `.claude/external/run-full-tests.sh` — a thin wrapper that runs the
   project's full test suite. Same inference path as (3).

- Artifacts 1 + 2 gate `/task-add`, which refuses to run until they exist.
- Artifacts 3 + 4 are the project's **test-dispatch convention**: one stable
  pair of entry points for its affected and full test suites, so runner
  knowledge stays in the project and travels with it via git. Nothing in the
  `task-*` suite invokes them automatically — `/task-implement` resolves the
  test command itself and never reads them — but a project that wires its own
  scripts, CI or CLAUDE.md to them has one place to change when the runner
  changes.
- Default: a pure authoring command, like `/context-build` — write the
  scaffolding and leave everything uncommitted for the user to review and
  commit. `--commit` commits exactly what this run wrote, then pushes (see
  PHASE — COMMIT below); `--commit --no-push` commits without pushing.
- Shell out for exactly two things: filesystem prep (`mkdir -p` for
  `.claude/tasks` and `.claude/external`, `chmod +x` on the wrapper scripts)
  and, ONLY when `--commit` is passed, the pull/commit/push sequence. Without
  `--commit`, run NO git/VCS command.

WORKFLOW

Before anything else, parse $ARGUMENTS:
- `--commit` → COMMIT = true. Default COMMIT = false: the run leaves its
  scaffolding uncommitted.
- `--attended` / `--unattended` → strip whichever appear.
- `--no-push` → NO_PUSH = true. It matters only when COMMIT is true: skip the
  pull at start, the pre-push re-sync and the push, still committing as
  always. When COMMIT is false there is nothing to push regardless.

Then:
- Resolve the run's interaction policy from the `--attended` /
  `--unattended` flags, a policy handed down by a parent run and the
  project's `CLAUDE.md`, per
  `../skills/interaction-engine/references/policy.md`, which also holds their
  argument errors.
  - Under `unattended`, read
    `../skills/interaction-engine/references/gates.md` — this command has no
    parking mechanism.
  - Read `../skills/interaction-engine/references/messages.md` before the
    first question and before the step 3 report, which follows its output
    rules.
- If COMMIT is true and the project's CLAUDE.md does not carry a `## VCS`
  override (non-git), run `git pull` on the current branch before any
  artifact is checked. On a conflict, stop the run here: report the conflict
  output and tell the user to resolve manually and re-run.
- Check each artifact individually and create it only if missing. Never
  overwrite an existing artifact without explicit user confirmation — a
  re-run on a partially or fully initialized project must be idempotent.
- Maintain a `WRITTEN` list of paths actually written or overwritten this
  invocation. Each successful Write, and each `mkdir -p` of a directory that
  did not previously exist, appends to it; idempotent no-ops do not.
  `WRITTEN` drives the step 3 report and the optional commit in PHASE —
  COMMIT.

1. **Probe every artifact:**
   - `.claude/TASKS.md` — use the Read tool; "file not found" means it
     does not exist.
   - `.claude/tasks/` — use Glob `.claude/tasks/*` or list it.
   - `.claude/external/run-affected-tests.sh` — use the Read tool.
   - `.claude/external/run-full-tests.sh` — use the Read tool.

2. **Create whichever are missing:**
   - `.claude/TASKS.md` missing → create it with the Write tool, with this
     exact stub content and no task entries (the first task added sits below
     this header):

     ```
     # Tasks

     Last task number: 0
     ```

   - `.claude/tasks/` missing → `mkdir -p .claude/tasks`.
   - Either wrapper script (`run-affected-tests.sh` / `run-full-tests.sh`)
     missing → create the parent directory if needed
     (`mkdir -p .claude/external`), then run **TEST RUNNER INFERENCE** below.
     It produces either a real wrapper pair or — when the project has no
     detectable test runner and the user chooses skip-tests mode — a no-op
     stub pair. Either way, set the executable bit on both (`chmod +x`).

3. **Report to the user:**
   - For each artifact: created (with path) or already present.
   - If everything already existed, say "Backlog already initialized."
   - If anything was created, hint at usable next steps:
     - `/task-add` is usable once artifacts 1 + 2 exist.
     - The test-dispatch wrappers (artifacts 3 + 4) are usable directly
       once written, unless they are no-op stubs.
   - If the wrappers were written as no-op stubs, say so explicitly so the
     user knows skip-tests mode is in effect.
   - If `WRITTEN` is non-empty and `--commit` was NOT passed, close with an
     explicit reminder that nothing was committed — the scaffolding is left
     in the working tree for the user to review and commit when ready.

4. **Continue to PHASE — COMMIT.**

---

PHASE — COMMIT AND PUSH (only when `--commit` was passed)

If COMMIT is false (the default), do nothing here — the scaffolding stays
uncommitted.

If COMMIT is true:

1. If `WRITTEN` is empty (a fully idempotent re-run), make no commit and no
   push. Say so and stop — no empty commit.
2. Otherwise stage EXACTLY the paths in `WRITTEN` and commit them:

   ```
   git add -- <path1> <path2> ...      # exactly the entries of WRITTEN
   git commit -m "Initialize task backlog scaffolding"
   ```

   Never stage with `git add -A`, `git add .`, or `git add -u`.
3. On commit success, report the commit hash (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`).
   Then, unless NO_PUSH is true or this project's CLAUDE.md carries a
   `## VCS` override, re-sync with `git pull` immediately before pushing —
   upstream may have moved during the run — then `git push`.
4. On commit failure (e.g. a pre-commit hook rejects the commit): surface
   the exact output. Do NOT retry, amend, or use `--no-verify` /
   `--no-gpg-sign`. Files remain staged but uncommitted; tell the user.
5. On push failure (rejected, no upstream, no remote) or a pre-push
   conflict: surface the exact output. Never retry, never force-push. The
   commit exists locally; tell the user it needs a manual sync + push.

Make exactly one commit; never branch, tag or use hook-skipping flags.

TEST RUNNER INFERENCE

> **MIRRORED COPY** — the runner-inference heuristics below are duplicated in
> `skills/task-engine/references/test-runner.md`. Any edit here must be
> mirrored there.

Determine how this project runs its tests, then write the two wrapper
scripts. Inference uses the same heuristics as `task-engine`'s
testing-policy resolution. In order:

1. **Project convention beats heuristics.** If a `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`,
   or `.claude/` context file specifies a test command, use it.
2. **Infer from project files:**
   - `pytest.ini`, `pyproject.toml` with `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`, or
     `setup.cfg` with `[tool:pytest]` → `pytest`. Prefer
     `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest` on Windows or
     `.venv/bin/python -m pytest` on POSIX if a venv exists.
   - `package.json` with a `test` script → `npm test` (or `pnpm test` /
     `yarn test` if the lockfile indicates it).
   - `Cargo.toml` → `cargo test`.
   - `go.mod` → `go test ./...`.
   - `Gemfile` with rspec → `bundle exec rspec`.
   - Otherwise, scan for a `Makefile` target named `test` → `make test`.
3. If still ambiguous, ask the user before writing the wrappers — a real
   decision: under `unattended` the run stops with the question
   (`gates.md` § *Real decisions*), leaving the wrappers unwritten.

Once the test command is known, write:
- `run-affected-tests.sh` — invokes the runner against the test files passed
  on its command line (e.g. `pytest "$@"`, `npm test -- "$@"`,
  `cargo test "$@"`, etc.).
- `run-full-tests.sh` — invokes the runner with no arguments (`pytest`,
  `npm test`, `cargo test`, `go test ./...`, …).

**No-test-suite handling.** If no test runner can be inferred AND no test
directory (`tests/`, `test/`, `__tests__/`, `spec/`) exists, the project has
no test suite. Never install a test framework (pytest/jest/etc.) on your own.
Prompt the user once:

> This project has no detectable test suite. Two options:
>
> A. **Halt.** Don't write the wrapper scripts. Set up a test suite
>    (or have me scaffold one), then re-run `/task-setup`.
>
> B. **Skip tests.** Write no-op stub wrappers that exit 0, so anything
>    wired to the test-dispatch convention keeps working while the
>    project has no suite.
>
> Halt, or write skip-tests stubs?

- A real decision: under `unattended` the run stops with this question,
  leaving the wrappers unwritten (`gates.md` § *Real decisions*).
- **A** → do not write the wrapper scripts; report the artifacts left
  missing.
- **B** → settle the testing policy, then write the stubs:
  1. If the project's `CLAUDE.md` already carries the line
     `Testing policy for /task-implement: skip-tests` or
     `… skip-tests-unattended` — `/project-setup` writes it before running
     this command — keep that line, ask nothing more, and go on to the stubs.
  2. Otherwise ask which testing policy `/task-implement` should record for
     the project — a real decision, stopping the run under `unattended` like
     the question above:

     > Which testing policy should `/task-implement` use here?
     >
     > a. `skip-tests` — implement without tests, confirming before each task.
     > b. `skip-tests-unattended` — implement without tests, no per-task
     >    confirmation.

     Write the answer into the project's `CLAUDE.md` as the line
     `Testing policy for /task-implement: <value>`, inside a
     `## Tasks implementation` section:
     - Append the section when missing (and create `CLAUDE.md` when missing).
     - Update an existing `Testing policy for /task-implement:` line in it in
       place rather than duplicating it.
     - Append `CLAUDE.md` to `WRITTEN` and name the line in the step 3 report.
  3. Write both scripts as no-op stubs that exit 0 with a clear message.

**Stub sentinel.** The stubs MUST contain the literal sentinel comment line:

```
# CHOSKO_TASK_IMPL_STUB
```

The sentinel marks a wrapper as a stub rather than a real dispatcher — this
command's own re-run check below reads it, and downstream projects already
carry it on disk. Suggested stub body:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# CHOSKO_TASK_IMPL_STUB
# Generated by /task-setup in skip-tests mode. Replace this script with
# a real test-runner invocation once the project has a test suite, then
# re-run /task-setup to regenerate.
echo "[skip-tests] no test suite configured for this project" >&2
exit 0
```

**Re-running with newly-added tests.** If the existing wrappers carry the
`# CHOSKO_TASK_IMPL_STUB` sentinel but the project now has a detectable test
runner (the user added one since the last `/task-setup`), prompt before
overwriting:

> The existing wrapper scripts are skip-tests stubs, but I now detect a
> <runner> setup in this project. Replace the stubs with real wrappers?
> [y/N]

- Gate class: `destructive` — it waits under every policy; under
  `unattended`, where nobody answers, the run stops with it and the stubs
  stay.
- `y` → overwrite both stubs with the inferred real wrappers.
- `n` → leave them alone.

**Wrappers that are not stubs are never overwritten** — once the user has a
real wrapper, treat it as theirs to edit.

---

FORMATS (for reference — `/task-setup` writes neither)

- The index file's format, and the `Last task number` counter that only ever
  increases: `../skills/task-engine/references/resolution.md`
  § *Index file format*.
- The per-task body format: `/task-add`'s, `./task-add.md` § PER-TASK BODY
  FILE FORMAT. The metadata that describes a task's place in the backlog —
  `Status:`, `Preconditions:` and `Feature:` — lives only in `TASKS.md`.

---

DO NOT:
- Create any task entries — `/task-setup` only creates the empty
  scaffolding. The first task is added by `/task-add`.
- Overwrite an existing `TASKS.md` or any `.claude/tasks/<N>.md` file.
  These files may have been edited by the user; never clobber them.
