version: 0.4.1
type: command
description: Capture what this conversation knows — what was tried, what failed, what was left alone on purpose, which files are half-finished and the exact next step — into a timestamped handoff file under .claude/sessions/. Use it before a conversation ends with work in flight.
requires: skill:interaction-engine
project-policy: vcs:rm

# /session-save
# Global command: write a per-project handoff file so the state of an
# in-flight conversation survives its end. Single pass — no phases, no
# conversation, no supporting files. Writes the full nine-section form, or a
# pointer when the work already has its own resume artifact; never rewrites a
# file in place. Commits and pushes the handoff by default, since a handoff
# usually crosses machines.
# Usage: /session-save
#        /session-save <slug>
#        /session-save [<slug>] --no-commit  (write the handoff, skip the commit and push)
#        /session-save [<slug>] --attended | --unattended
#        /session-save [<slug>] --no-push    (commit as usual, skip the push)
#        /session-save [<slug>] --commit     (accepted; changes nothing — the default already commits)
# Examples: /session-save
#           /session-save ecc-import-architecture

GOAL

- Write one file under `.claude/sessions/` capturing what this session knows
  and nothing else knows: what was tried, what failed and why, what was
  deliberately not tried, which files are half-finished, and the exact next
  step. The task backlog records *what* was done and `.claude/context/`
  records *where things are*; neither records the middle.
- Write the handoff and commit it. Do not start, finish or continue the work
  being handed off — writing the file is where this command ends — and clean
  up nothing beyond the one deletion under SUPERSESSION DELETE.
- A handoff crosses the gap between sessions, usually between machines, and an
  untracked file crosses nothing.

$ARGUMENTS

---

## ARGUMENT PARSING

1. Scan `$ARGUMENTS` for these flags and strip whichever appear:

   | Flag | Effect |
   |---|---|
   | `--no-commit` | Set COMMIT = false. Write the handoff, but make no commit and no push. Implies NO_PUSH. |
   | `--no-push` | Set NO_PUSH = true. Commit as usual, skip the pull/re-sync/push. |
   | `--commit` | Accepted and changes nothing — COMMIT is already true. |
   | `--attended` / `--unattended` | The interaction policy, resolved with a parent's policy and the project's `CLAUDE.md` per `../skills/interaction-engine/references/policy.md`, which holds their argument errors. Under `unattended`, read `../skills/interaction-engine/references/gates.md`. |

2. Read `../skills/interaction-engine/references/messages.md` before the first
   question; every question and the closing report follow it.
3. COMMIT is true unless `--no-commit` is passed. If `--commit` and
   `--no-commit` both appear, stop with:
   `--commit and --no-commit cannot be combined. Pick one.` That and the
   interaction policy's own argument errors are the only refusals over an
   argument.
4. Treat what is left as empty or a single slug:
   - Empty — generate the slug yourself (see WHERE THE FILE GOES).
   - A slug — use it verbatim as `<slug>`, lower-casing it and replacing
     spaces with hyphens if it is not already kebab-case.
   - Anything else is not a recognized argument. Say so in one line and carry
     on with a generated slug — never refuse over any other argument.
5. **Pull at start.** Unless COMMIT is false or NO_PUSH is true, run
   `git pull` on the current branch once, before anything is written.
   - On a conflict, stop the run there: report the output and tell the user to
     resolve manually and re-run.
   - On a non-git VCS (a `## VCS` section in `CLAUDE.md`), skip it.

---

## WHERE THE FILE GOES

```
.claude/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<slug>.md
```

- Writing the file creates `.claude/sessions/` on the first save; run no
  separate `mkdir` for the session file.
- `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM` is the local date and time now. Read the clock **once**:
  use the date and time the session context already carries if it has them,
  otherwise run `date` a single time.
- Run only these shell commands: that clock read, the `mkdir`, `mv` and
  `rmdir` commands of HANDOFF MOVE, and the git commands of the
  commit-and-push protocol (ARGUMENT PARSING's pull at start, COMMIT AND
  PUSH). Run no `ls`, no `grep`, and no other `git`.
- Make `<slug>` a **two-or-three-word kebab-case summary of the work** — not a
  random id and not a generic word like `session` or `handoff`. The user finds
  an old session by its slug (`/session-list` shows it,
  `/session-resume <slug>` resumes by it), so it has to say what the session was about:
  `ecc-import-architecture`, `upgrade-readout-bug`, `roadmap-milestones`.
- **Never update a session file in place**, append to one, or reuse its
  filename. Every save is a new file: a second `/session-save` in the same
  conversation writes a second file with a later timestamp. A handoff is a
  snapshot.
- Remove no file except the one named under SUPERSESSION DELETE, and remove
  it whole — never edit it.
- Write nothing outside `.claude/sessions/`. Do not touch `.gitignore`; do not
  write to `TASKS.md`, `FEATURES.md`, `PLAN.md`, a feature document, or
  anything under `.claude/context/`; do not create a placeholder anywhere.
- Write for a reader, not for a parser. A session file is context for a human
  or an agent and never input to tooling: no `chosko-llm` subcommand walks
  `.claude/sessions/`, and nothing derives from it — `/task-list`,
  `/production-status` and every CLI subcommand are unaffected and unaware.

---

## THE HEADER BLOCK — both forms

Open every session file, full form or pointer form, with the same three lines:

```markdown
# Session: 2026-08-24 14:30

Work: task 118
Running: /task-implement
```

**`Work:`** — the one typed line linking this session to the document the work
belongs to. Write exactly one of four values:

| Value | Written when | Points at |
|---|---|---|
| `task <n>` | a task was being implemented or authored | `.claude/tasks/<n>.md` |
| `feature <slug>` | `/architect` or feature-level design work | `.claude/domain/features/<slug>.md` |
| `document <path>` | product-design, roadmap, plan, or context work | that file |
| `none` | a generic session with no anchor | — |

- Treat `none` as a **first-class value, not a failure** — e.g. a debugging
  session that touched no backlog document. Inventing a link for an
  anchorless session would make the link untrustworthy everywhere else.
- `none` may carry a short trailing explanation after an em dash:

```
Work: none — cross-feature architecture session, five features authored
```

- Never write two `Work:` values, never write a list, and never guess a task
  number to avoid writing `none`.

**`Running:`** — name the skill or command in flight (`/task-implement`,
`/product-design`, `/architect`), or what the session was doing when there was
none (`free-form debugging`, `/claude-council, then free-form architecture`).

- Infer it from the conversation. **Do not read any state to find out.**
- If the inference is not clear, ask the user once.

---

## WHICH FORM — artifact detection

Pick the form by detecting whether the work in flight already has a **resume
artifact**: a project-scoped state document carrying a resume marker — a
current-stage, phase, or next-step line a later session reads to know where
the last one stopped. Both properties are required: it lives inside the user's
project (not inside an installed skill folder), and its marker is rewritten as
the work progresses.

The command detects; skills declare nothing. A skill that gains a resume
artifact needs no change here, and one that loses it degrades to the full form
on its own.

Resolve in two steps, in this order:

1. **The known-artifact table.**

   | Skill in flight | Resume artifact |
   |---|---|
   | `/product-design` | `.claude/domain/design-process.md` |

   - That is the whole table. Add a row **only** when a skill actually ships a
     project-scoped state document carrying a resume marker — nothing else
     qualifies.
   - A static instruction file shipping with an installed skill is not a
     resume artifact: it holds no session state, and its path is relative to
     the installed skill folder rather than to the project.
   - `/task-implement` deliberately has no row — its state is a half-finished
     working tree plus what was tried, not a file — so its sessions take the
     full form.

2. **The recency check.** If no table row matches, look for a file **written
   during this session** that carries a resume marker. If one is found, offer
   the pointer form:

   > `<path>` was written this session and carries a resume marker, so it already
   > holds the state. Write a pointer to it instead of a full handoff? [Y/n]

   - On yes, write the pointer form. On no, or on anything unclear, write the
     full form.
   - Gate class: `confirmation`
     (`../skills/interaction-engine/references/gates.md`) — under
     `unattended` it passes on its own and the pointer form is written.

No table row and no recent artifact, or no skill running at all: write the
**full form** — the generic and common case. Never write both forms.

---

## FULL FORM

Write the header block, then an **optional one-paragraph preamble** framing the
handoff, then all nine sections below, in this order, as `##` headings:

1. **What we are building** — the goal in the session's own terms.
2. **What worked (with evidence)** — every claim carries the command output,
   test name, or file that proves it.
3. **What did not work (and why)** — the highest-value section: what the next
   session would otherwise repeat, at full cost, before discovering the same
   thing.
4. **What has not been tried yet** — approaches considered and skipped, so a
   later session does not mistake them for approaches already ruled out.
5. **Current state of files** — a table with columns `File | Status | Notes`.
   `Status` is exactly one of **Complete**, **In progress**, **Broken**, or
   **Not started**.
6. **Decisions made** — each with its reason, so it can be revisited rather
   than silently inherited.
7. **Blockers and open questions.**
8. **Exact next step** — one concrete action, specific enough to start on
   without re-deriving anything.
9. **Environment and setup notes** — anything non-obvious about how to run
   things.

Rules for the content:

- **Write every section, always.** Put `N/A` or `nothing yet` where a section
  is genuinely empty — a skipped section is indistinguishable from an
  overlooked one.
- **Evidence or it is a guess.** Write a claim under "what worked" that has no
  command output, test name or file behind it as a guess ("believed to work —
  not verified"). Never present an inference as a verified result.
- Write what only this conversation knows. Do not restate or copy what is
  already on disk in `TASKS.md`, a feature document or a context file — link
  to it instead.

---

## POINTER FORM

Write the header block, a `Resume from:` line, and one sentence — the whole
file:

```markdown
# Session: 2026-08-24 14:32

Work: document .claude/domain/product-design.md
Running: /product-design
Resume from: .claude/domain/design-process.md

Read that file. It holds the state; this one only says where it is.
```

Add no narrative, no file table, no decisions, no next step: the artifact owns
the state, and a second account of it could disagree.

---

## SUPERSESSION DELETE

If **this conversation itself resumed from a session file**, write the new
snapshot first, then delete the file it resumed from — it is superseded, and
two snapshots of the same work must never coexist in the directory.

- Take the path from the conversation. `/session-resume` states which file it
  loaded, explicitly, in its briefing.
- **Delete nothing when you cannot tell.** No searching the directory for a
  likely candidate, no deleting by date, no deleting the second-newest file on
  a hunch. Never auto-delete an unresumed session file.
- Delete only after the new file is written. Never before, and never instead.
- Report the deletion on its own line, beside the path written.

---

## HANDOFF MOVE

Area handoffs — one `agent-<area>.md` per area of an orchestrate-mode
conversation — live in `.claude/sessions/pending/` until the conversation's
first save, and afterwards in the folder named after the newest session file's
stem (its filename without `.md`). After the new file is written and any
SUPERSESSION DELETE is done, bring them under the new stem:

1. **Find them** with the Glob tool, never a shell listing:
   `.claude/sessions/pending/agent-*.md`, and — when this conversation
   already wrote a session file, or resumed from one — the same pattern in
   that file's stem folder, `.claude/sessions/<previous-stem>/agent-*.md`.
   None found: nothing changes, and this section ends.
2. **Move each one** into `.claude/sessions/<new-stem>/`, keeping its
   filename: create the folder once with
   `mkdir -p -- .claude/sessions/<new-stem>`, then
   `mv -- <old-path> <new-path>`, one per file. Never read or edit its
   content.
3. **Remove each source folder left empty** — `pending/`, or the previous
   stem's folder — with `rmdir -- <folder>`, which refuses a folder that is
   not empty.

Run the moves under `--no-commit` too; only the staging is skipped there.

---

## COMMIT AND PUSH (skipped under `--no-commit`)

If COMMIT is false, do nothing here and run no git command.

Otherwise (the default), after the file is written, any SUPERSESSION DELETE is
done and HANDOFF MOVE has run, follow the commit-and-push protocol — four
steps, in this order:

1. **Pull at start.** Already run before anything was written, per ARGUMENT
   PARSING.
2. **Commit.** Stage by explicit path, in separate commands:
   - Exactly the new session file: `git add -- <new-path>`.
   - When SUPERSESSION DELETE removed a file, its deletion:
     `git rm --cached --quiet --ignore-unmatch -- <superseded-path>`. This
     stages the deletion when git was tracking the file and does nothing when
     it was not (a handoff written by an earlier `--no-commit` save, say), so
     an untracked superseded path never aborts staging of the new file.
   - When HANDOFF MOVE moved handoffs, each new path
     (`git add -- <new-path> …`) and each old path's removal
     (`git rm --cached --quiet --ignore-unmatch -- <old-path> …`).
   - Stage nothing else — never `git add -A`, `git add .` or `git add -u`.

   Make one commit: `git commit -m "Save session <slug>"`. The new snapshot,
   the removal of the one it replaces and the moved handoffs are one unit of
   work.
3. **Pre-push re-sync.** Unless NO_PUSH is true, `git pull` again. On a
   conflict: abort the merge, keep the local commit, do not push, and report
   that it needs a manual sync and push.
4. **Push.** Unless NO_PUSH is true, `git push`. On failure, report the exact
   output and stop — never retry, never force-push.

- On a non-git VCS (a `## VCS` section in `CLAUDE.md`), run only the commit
  step.
- On a commit failure (a pre-commit hook, say), surface the exact output and
  stop — do not retry, amend or skip hooks.
- The session file stays written either way.
- Never commit twice, amend, skip hooks, force-push, branch, or tag.

---

## REPORTING

On success, report exactly this much:

```
Wrote .claude/sessions/2026-08-24-1430-ecc-import-architecture.md (full form)
Deleted .claude/sessions/2026-08-23-0915-ecc-import-architecture.md (superseded)
Moved 3 area handoffs into .claude/sessions/2026-08-24-1430-ecc-import-architecture/
Committed a1b2c3d — Save session ecc-import-architecture
```

- Include the deletion line only when SUPERSESSION DELETE actually removed a
  file, and the move line only when HANDOFF MOVE moved at least one handoff.
- The last line carries the commit hash (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`), with
  `(not pushed)` appended under `--no-push`.
- Under `--no-commit`, the last line is instead
  `Nothing committed — the session file is uncommitted.` — not repeated or
  expanded on.
