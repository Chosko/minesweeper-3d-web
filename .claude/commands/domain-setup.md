# /domain-setup
# Global command: initialize the project's domain knowledge layer. Creates
# `.claude/domain/` and `.claude/domain/features/`, a
# `.claude/domain/INDEX.md` navigation index, the `.claude/FEATURES.md`
# feature index, and a CLAUDE.md pointer at the domain index. Idempotent: a
# re-run leaves existing artifacts untouched and only creates the missing
# ones. Safe on a project that already has hand-written domain docs — those
# get indexed rather than replaced. Authoring command — leaves everything
# uncommitted for review unless `--commit` is passed.
# Usage: /domain-setup                     (leaves the scaffolding uncommitted)
# Usage: /domain-setup --commit            (commit and push the scaffolding this run wrote)
# Usage: /domain-setup --commit --no-push  (commit locally, skip the push)
# Usage: /domain-setup <any of the above> --attended | --unattended

GOAL

`.claude/domain/` holds the project's product and rules knowledge — what the
product is, how its features are designed, why the architecture is what it
is. `/task-add` reads it; `/context-build` and `/context-update` never write
it; `/product-design` and `/architect` both write into it, so it must exist
and be navigable first. This command is their gate.

Create the artifacts the rest of the product pipeline assumes:

1. `.claude/domain/` — the domain layer directory.
2. `.claude/domain/features/` — one document per low-level feature, written
   later by `/architect`.
3. `.claude/domain/INDEX.md` — the domain-layer navigation index: a
   `| File | Covers |` table matching the shape of
   `.claude/context/INDEX.md`. On a project that already has hand-written
   domain docs, index them here.
4. `.claude/FEATURES.md` — the feature index, a sibling of `TASKS.md` at the
   `.claude/` root (it indexes work items the way `TASKS.md` does); the
   feature *documents* it points at are knowledge and live under
   `.claude/domain/features/`.
5. A CLAUDE.md navigation pointer at `.claude/domain/INDEX.md`.

Scope:
- Create the layer and nothing in it: no feature entries in
  `.claude/FEATURES.md` (entries are `/architect`'s), no design or feature
  documents — no `product-design.md`, no `technical-direction.md`, no
  `business-model.md`, no `features/<slug>.md`. Those belong to
  `/product-design` and `/architect`.
- Write nothing into `.claude/context/`. The context layer is
  `/context-build`'s and `/context-update`'s; only cross-reference it.
- By default, leave everything uncommitted in the working tree for the user
  to review and commit, matching `/task-setup`, `/context-build`, and
  `/project-setup`. `--commit` opts in to committing exactly what this run
  wrote, then pushing (see PHASE — COMMIT below); `--commit --no-push`
  commits without pushing.
- Shell out for exactly two things: filesystem prep (`mkdir -p` for
  `.claude/domain` and `.claude/domain/features`) and, ONLY when `--commit`
  is passed, the pull/commit/push sequence. Without `--commit`, run NO
  git/VCS command.

$ARGUMENTS

---

WORKFLOW

Before anything else, parse $ARGUMENTS:
- `--commit` — if present, set COMMIT = true. When COMMIT is false (the
  default), the run leaves its scaffolding uncommitted.
- `--attended` / `--unattended` — strip whichever appear. Resolve the run's
  interaction policy from them, a policy handed down by a parent run and the
  project's `CLAUDE.md`, per
  `../skills/interaction-engine/references/policy.md`, which holds their
  argument errors. Under `unattended`, read
  `../skills/interaction-engine/references/gates.md` — this command has no
  parking mechanism. Read
  `../skills/interaction-engine/references/messages.md` before the first
  question and before the step 4 report, which follows its output rules.
- `--no-push` — if present, set NO_PUSH = true. NO_PUSH only matters when
  COMMIT is true: it skips the pull at start, the pre-push re-sync and the
  push while still committing as always.

Pull at start: if COMMIT is true, NO_PUSH is not set, and the project's
CLAUDE.md does not carry a `## VCS` override (non-git), run `git pull` on the
current branch before any artifact is checked. A conflict stops the run
here — report the conflict output and tell the user to resolve manually and
re-run.

Rules for the whole run:
- Check each artifact individually and create it only if missing.
  Re-running `/domain-setup` on a partially or fully initialized project
  must be idempotent.
- Never overwrite an existing artifact without explicit user confirmation
  (gate class: `design`). Existing domain documents, an existing
  `.claude/domain/INDEX.md` and an existing `.claude/FEATURES.md` are
  hand-written knowledge: treat them as canonical — index them, never edit
  or clobber them.
- Maintain a `WRITTEN` list of paths actually written or overwritten this
  invocation. Each successful Write / `mkdir -p` (when the directory did not
  previously exist) appends to it; idempotent no-ops do not. `WRITTEN`
  drives the final report in step 4 and the optional commit in
  PHASE — COMMIT.

1. **Probe every artifact:**
   - `.claude/domain/` — use Glob `.claude/domain/*` or list it.
   - `.claude/domain/features/` — use Glob `.claude/domain/features/*`.
   - `.claude/domain/INDEX.md` — use the Read tool; "file not found" means
     it does not exist.
   - `.claude/FEATURES.md` — use the Read tool.
   - `CLAUDE.md` — use the Read tool. Note whether it exists and whether it
     already carries a pointer at `.claude/domain/INDEX.md`.

2. **Inventory any pre-existing domain docs.**
   - Glob `.claude/domain/**/*.md` (excluding `INDEX.md` itself). Expect a
     non-empty result — it is the common case, not an edge case.
   - For each file found, read its heading and opening paragraph — enough
     for one "Covers" cell, no more. Do not read them in full and do not
     modify them.

3. **Create whichever artifacts are missing:**
   - If `.claude/domain/` is missing, create it
     (`mkdir -p .claude/domain`).
   - If `.claude/domain/features/` is missing, create it
     (`mkdir -p .claude/domain/features`).
   - If `.claude/domain/INDEX.md` is missing, use the Write tool to create
     it from the **DOMAIN INDEX TEMPLATE** below, with one table row per
     document inventoried in step 2. When step 2 found nothing, write the
     table header with no rows — never invent rows for documents that do
     not exist.
   - If `.claude/FEATURES.md` is missing, use the Write tool to create it
     with the exact stub in the **FEATURES.md STUB** below. No entries.
   - If CLAUDE.md carries no pointer at `.claude/domain/INDEX.md`, add one
     per **CLAUDE.md POINTER** below. If CLAUDE.md does not exist at all,
     create a minimal one containing just that pointer — the same fallback
     `/context-build` uses.

4. **Report to the user:**
   - For each artifact: created (with path) or already present.
   - If everything already existed and no pointer was needed, say "Domain
     layer already initialized." and write nothing.
   - When step 2 found pre-existing docs, list which ones were indexed.
   - If anything was created, hint at the usable next steps:
     `/product-design` to design the product top-down, or `/architect`
     to go straight to a feature document on a project whose direction is
     already settled.
   - If `WRITTEN` is non-empty and `--commit` was NOT passed, close with an
     explicit reminder that nothing was committed — the scaffolding is left
     in the working tree for the user to review and commit when ready.

5. **Continue to PHASE — COMMIT.**

DOMAIN INDEX TEMPLATE

Write `.claude/domain/INDEX.md` in this shape (the `| File | Covers |` table
matches `.claude/context/INDEX.md`):

```
# Domain index

Product and rules knowledge for <project name>. Read this first, then the
files relevant to your task.

This layer answers WHAT the product is and WHY it is built this way. For
CODEBASE STRUCTURE — which file implements what — see
[../context/INDEX.md](../context/INDEX.md) if the project has a context
layer.

## Files

| File | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| [<name>.md](./<name>.md) | <one line, from the document's heading and opening paragraph> |

## Features

Low-level feature documents live under [features/](./features/), one per
feature, written by `/architect`. The feature index — status and generated
task IDs per feature — is [../FEATURES.md](../FEATURES.md).
```

- Write one row per document found in step 2, in alphabetical order.
- Write the "Covers" cell from what the document actually says. If a file's
  subject cannot be summarized from its heading and opening paragraph, say
  so in the report rather than guessing in the table.

---

FEATURES.md STUB

Write `.claude/FEATURES.md` with exactly this content:

```
# Features
```

A fresh `FEATURES.md` never has an entry. `/architect` appends entries, one
per feature; their shape, the `Status:` values and who writes each field are
`../skills/architect/feature-doc-template.md` § *`.claude/FEATURES.md`
entry*.

---

CLAUDE.md POINTER

Use this pointer — it is explicit about when to read the layer:

> For product and domain knowledge — what this product is, how its
> features are designed, and why the architecture is what it is — read
> `.claude/domain/INDEX.md`, then only the domain files relevant to your
> task.

Compose it with what is already there; never duplicate an existing
navigation instruction or overwrite one:

- If CLAUDE.md already has a navigation instruction from `/context-build`
  (pointing at `.claude/context/INDEX.md`), add the domain pointer
  alongside it under the same navigation heading — never replace it; both
  pointers coexist — and make the division of labour explicit: context =
  codebase structure, domain = product and rules.
- If CLAUDE.md exists with no navigation section, add the pointer near the
  top, before project-specific detail.
- If CLAUDE.md does not exist, create a minimal one containing only this
  pointer.
- If a pointer at `.claude/domain/INDEX.md` is already present in any
  form, leave CLAUDE.md alone entirely — this is the idempotent case.

---

PHASE — COMMIT AND PUSH (only when `--commit` was passed)

If COMMIT is false (the default), do nothing here — the scaffolding is left
uncommitted for the user to review.

If COMMIT is true (the pull-at-start already ran in WORKFLOW):

1. If `WRITTEN` is empty (a fully idempotent re-run that wrote nothing),
   make no commit (and no push). Say so and stop — no empty commit.
2. Otherwise, make exactly one commit: stage EXACTLY the paths in `WRITTEN`
   and commit them:

   ```
   git add -- <path1> <path2> ...      # exactly the entries of WRITTEN
   git commit -m "Initialize domain knowledge layer"
   ```

   - Stage ONLY the entries of `WRITTEN`. Never use `git add -A`,
     `git add .`, or `git add -u`.
   - Never branch or tag, and never use hook-skipping flags
     (`--no-verify`, `--no-gpg-sign`, `--amend`).
   - On a non-git VCS, use the project's `## VCS` mapping in CLAUDE.md
     (git→`cm`).
3. On commit success, report the commit hash (`git rev-parse --short
   HEAD`). Then, unless NO_PUSH is true or the non-git VCS exemption
   applies, re-sync with `git pull` immediately before pushing — other
   commits may have landed upstream during the run — then `git push`.
4. On commit failure (e.g. a pre-commit hook rejects the commit): surface
   the exact output. Do NOT retry, amend, or use `--no-verify` /
   `--no-gpg-sign`. Files remain staged but uncommitted; tell the user.
5. On push failure (rejected, no upstream, no remote) or a pre-push
   conflict: surface the exact output. Never retry, never force-push. The
   commit exists locally; tell the user it needs a manual sync + push.
