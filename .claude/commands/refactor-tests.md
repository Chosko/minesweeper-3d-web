# /refactor-tests
# Global command: finds test files exceeding a configurable line threshold and
# splits them into smaller, focused files. No renaming, deduplication, import
# sorting, or constants extraction — splitting only.
#
# Usage — split all oversized test files (default threshold: 300 lines):
#   /refactor-tests
#
# Usage — use a custom line threshold:
#   /refactor-tests threshold=200
#
# Usage — commit and push the splits when done (default leaves them uncommitted):
#   /refactor-tests --commit
#
# Usage — commit locally, skip the push:
#   /refactor-tests --commit --no-push

$ARGUMENTS

---

GOAL

Split test files that exceed the configured line threshold into smaller,
focused files, relocating tests without altering their signatures, fixture
references, or imports. The test suite must stay green throughout.

---

ARGUMENT PARSING

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for an optional `threshold=<N>` key-value pair
(e.g. `threshold=200`). If absent, use 300.

Also parse the optional `--commit` flag: if present, set COMMIT = true.
When COMMIT is false (the default), the run leaves its splits uncommitted for
review.

Also parse the optional `--no-push` flag: if present, set NO_PUSH = true.
NO_PUSH only matters when COMMIT is true — it skips the pull at start, the
pre-push re-sync and the push while still committing as always. When COMMIT is
true and no non-git `## VCS` override applies, pull at start here (before
STEP 1) — run `git pull` on the current branch. A conflict stops the run
immediately; report the conflict output and tell the user to resolve
manually and re-run.

Also parse the optional `--attended` and `--unattended` flags and strip
whichever appear. The run's interaction policy resolves from them, a policy
handed down by a parent run and the project's `CLAUDE.md`, per
`../skills/interaction-engine/references/policy.md`, which holds their
argument errors; under `unattended`, read
`../skills/interaction-engine/references/gates.md`. Read
`../skills/interaction-engine/references/messages.md` before STEP 3 — the
proposal and the final summary follow it. Any other arguments are ignored.

---

STEP 1 — ESTABLISH A GREEN BASELINE

Detect and run the project's test suite (follow the same heuristics as
`/task-implement`: check CLAUDE.md first, then infer from project files —
pytest, npm test, cargo test, go test, etc.).

If no test suite is detectable, stop and report:
> No test suite found. `/refactor-tests` requires a runnable test suite to
> verify splits do not break anything. Set up a test suite first.

If the suite is red, stop and report:
> Baseline is red — fix the failing tests before running `/refactor-tests`.
> Output: <test runner output>

Do NOT proceed until a green baseline is confirmed.

---

STEP 2 — SCAN FOR OVERSIZED TEST FILES

Scan the repository for test files exceeding the threshold (from STEP 1's
argument parsing). A "test file" is any file whose name matches common
test-file patterns for the detected language (e.g. `test_*.py`, `*_test.py`,
`*.test.js`, `*.spec.ts`, files under `tests/`, `test/`, `__tests__/`,
`spec/`).

For each candidate, record its path and exact line count.

If no files exceed the threshold, report:
> Nothing to split — no test files exceed <threshold> lines. Exiting cleanly.

and stop.

---

STEP 3 — PROPOSE AND CONFIRM

Present the list of oversized files in a table:

```
File                          Lines
------------------------------  -----
tests/test_auth.py              512
tests/test_orders.py            387
```

Then ask:
> Proceed with splitting these <N> file(s)? [y/N]

Wait for explicit confirmation. If the user answers anything other than
`y` or `yes` (case-insensitive), stop without modifying any file. Gate class:
`confirmation` — under `unattended` it passes on its own, and the final
summary names the commit or, without `--commit`, the uncommitted splits.

---

STEP 4 — SPLIT, ONE FILE AT A TIME

For each confirmed file, in the order listed:

1. **Plan the split.** Identify natural responsibility boundaries within
   the file (e.g. a large test file covering authentication AND billing
   can split into `test_auth.py` and `test_billing.py`). Aim for files
   under the threshold after the split. Do NOT create more than the
   minimum number of new files needed to bring all fragments under the
   threshold.

2. **Relocate tests.** Move test functions / test classes into the new
   file(s). Preserve every signature, fixture reference, import, and
   parametrize decorator exactly as written — this is a pure relocation.
   Update imports in the new files to match what was in the original.

3. **Remove relocated tests from the original.** If all tests in the
   original have been relocated, delete the original file entirely. If
   some tests remain below the threshold, keep the trimmed original.

4. **Run the test suite.** If the suite is red, stop immediately and
   report:
   > Split of <filename> produced a red suite — stopping. No further
   > files will be touched.
   > Output: <test runner output>
   
   Do NOT proceed to the next file. Leave the repo in whatever state the
   split produced — the user must review and decide how to proceed.

5. **Report the split.** Print a one-line summary:
   > Split <original> → <new-file-1> (<N> tests), <new-file-2> (<M> tests)

---

STEP 5 — FINAL REPORT

After all files are processed (or after a stop), print:

```
/refactor-tests complete
  Files split:   N
  Files skipped: 0  (already under threshold after earlier splits)
  Suite status:  green
```

If the run stopped early due to a red suite, replace "Suite status: green"
with "Suite status: RED — stopped at <filename>".

---

STEP 6 — COMMIT AND PUSH (only when `--commit` was passed)

If COMMIT is false (the default), do nothing here — the splits are left
uncommitted for the user to review. This is the default behavior and is
unchanged.

If COMMIT is true (the pull-at-start from ARGUMENT PARSING already ran):

1. If no files were split (STEP 2 found nothing, or the user declined at
   STEP 3), make no commit (and no push). Say so and stop.
2. If the run STOPPED EARLY on a red suite, make NO commit (and no push) —
   the repo is in a half-split state the user must review. Say so and stop.
3. Otherwise, after a green final suite, stage EXACTLY the test files this
   run touched — every new file created, every trimmed original, and
   (using `git add -- <path>`, which also records deletions) every
   original that was deleted. Build the path list explicitly from the
   per-split reports; never use a catch-all (`git add -A` / `git add .` /
   `git add -u`).
4. Commit once: `git commit -m "Split oversized test files"`.
5. On commit success, report the commit hash (`git rev-parse --short
   HEAD`). Then, unless NO_PUSH is true or the non-git VCS exemption
   applies, re-sync with `git pull` immediately before pushing — other
   commits may have landed upstream during the run — then `git push`.
6. On commit failure (e.g. a pre-commit hook rejects the commit): surface
   the exact output. Do NOT retry, amend, or use `--no-verify` /
   `--no-gpg-sign`. Files remain staged but uncommitted; tell the user.
7. On push failure (rejected, no upstream, no remote) or a pre-push
   conflict: surface the exact output. Never retry, never force-push. The
   commit exists locally; tell the user it needs a manual sync + push.

INVARIANTS

- Tests are relocated verbatim. No signature changes, no logic changes.
- A split that produces a red suite halts the entire run.
- The command never touches non-test files.
- The command never performs renaming, deduplication, import sorting, or
  constants extraction — those concerns belong to `/refactor-codebase`.
