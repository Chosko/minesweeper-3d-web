version: 0.2.0
type: command
description: List what this conversation would lose if it ended now — actions proposed but never executed, outcomes never recorded on disk, decisions written down nowhere — as a numbered list, or exactly `No follow-ups left`. Use it before a session ends, or when a run stopped early.

# /follow-ups
# Global command: read this conversation and list what it would lose if it
# ended now. Read-only — no file is opened, nothing is written, nothing is
# invoked. Takes no arguments. The answer is the bare line `No follow-ups
# left`, or a numbered list under a `Follow-ups` heading, each item a slash
# command plus a short "to …" explanation wherever a command fits. Work
# already tracked on disk is never a follow-up. When the conversation holds a
# working list, the answer is that list. The numbering is the handle: the user
# may reply by number, and acting on a reply is the `follow-ups-resolve`
# skill's, not something this command implements.
# Usage: /follow-ups

GOAL
Answer one question: **if this conversation ended right now, what would be
lost?** An empty answer is a guarantee, not a shrug — it says the session
can be quit with no information and no operation left behind.

WHAT COUNTS
Read the conversation, and nothing else. Three kinds of thing are
follow-ups:

- an **action proposed but never executed** — something this session said
  it would do, or offered to do, and did not;
- an **outcome never recorded on disk** — something that happened here and
  left no trace in a file, an index or a commit;
- a **decision or fact taken in conversation and written down nowhere** —
  it exists only in the transcript, and the transcript is what is about to
  go away.

WHAT DOES NOT
Work already tracked on disk is not a follow-up. `/runbook-run X to
continue the implementation` is not one: the runbook already holds those
steps, and the next session finds them by reading it. But a task created in
this conversation and not yet appended to the running runbook **is** one —
nothing on disk connects it to the work in flight, so it can slip out of
the implementation pipeline unnoticed. The test is not "is it written
down"; it is "does what is written down lead a later session to it".

THE OUTPUT
Exactly one of:

- the single line `No follow-ups left`, bare — no heading above it, because a
  heading over one fixed line adds nothing and other bodies match that line
  exactly; or
- the heading `Follow-ups`, then a numbered list, one follow-up per item, so
  a reader scanning a long turn sees where the list starts.

Nothing else — no preamble, no summary of the conversation, no closing
offer.

Write each item as a slash command plus a short "to …" explanation wherever
a command fits the follow-up:

```
## Follow-ups

1. /task-add feature=password-auth to reconcile tasks 12 and 14, which went
   stale after the amendment
2. /runbook-create --append to put task 31 into the runbook this session is
   running
```

A free-form item is legal where no command fits. Prefer the command form
whenever one does.

When the conversation holds a working list — the one the
`follow-ups-resolve` skill keeps once the user has replied to a Follow-ups
list — the output is that list in its two-section shape: under the
`Follow-ups` heading, **Approved** first, then **Awaiting approval**, one
numbering running across both, and any follow-up the list lacks added under
**Awaiting approval**. Invoked while a `/runbook-run` is in flight, the
output is the list collected so far in that same two-section shape — the
follow-ups the run has printed as they arose, with any approvals already
given. An empty working list is the line `No follow-ups left`.

A run-closing skill — `/runbook-run`, `/task-implement` — may apply these
rules as the second group of its own closing report, under this same
`Follow-ups` heading, its own items folded into the one numbering; this
command, invoked on its own, is unchanged by that.

THE NUMBERING IS THE HANDLE
The numbers are there so the user can reply by number — "execute 1 and 2
now", "insert 3 as the next step in this runbook". Acting on a reply is the
`follow-ups-resolve` skill's, when it is available; this command does not
implement it, and does not offer to.

STOP THERE
Print the line or the list, and stop. Take no argument. Open no project
file — not `.claude/TASKS.md`, not a runbook, not the index. Write nothing,
commit nothing, and invoke no other command.
