# Design process

The state of this project's `/product-design` run. `/product-design` reads
this file to decide where to resume; nothing else records that.

## Method

Top-down product design. The user and Claude work through the phases below
conversationally; each phase's output is written into `product-design.md`
(and `business-model.md` when in scope) before the next begins, and the
technical foundations are written into `technical-direction.md` last.

Greenfield or brownfield: brownfield — a playable, deployed browser port
(three.js, static files on GitHub Pages) with a README, a gameplay spec and a
context layer already exists.
Business modelling: in scope

## Phases

| Phase | What it does | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — gate + resume | Verify the domain layer; resume or start fresh | done |
| 1 — orient + stub | Detect greenfield/brownfield, create the documents | done |
| 2 — interview | Product, users, experience, big decisions, business model | in progress |
| 3 — write-back | Fill product-design.md and business-model.md | not started |
| 4 — high-level features | Identify the feature set, user-experience angle | not started |
| 5 — feature write-back | Record the feature set in product-design.md | not started |
| 6 — technical direction | Decide the product's technical foundations | not started |
| 7 — technical write-back | Record the direction in technical-direction.md | not started |

## Current stage

**PHASE 2 — interview: in progress**

Covered: the product's new direction and its target players. Open: the
classic 2D mode's reference rules, no-guess and stats, the campaign's shape,
the mode list beyond 2D/3D/campaign, the key flows, and the business model
(Steam premium is the working assumption, nothing priced yet).

- `product-design.md`, `technical-direction.md`, `business-model.md` — stubs only.

Next step: continue the interview from the last open questions put to the user.

## Decisions worth keeping

- Goal: become the best Minesweeper game on Steam — a multi-mode game, not a port of the 2011 original.
- Primary players: Minesweeper enthusiasts choosing between Steam implementations they find unconvincing.
- The existing 3D game is settled and becomes the 3D mode, unchanged in substance.
- The 2D mode is rebuilt from scratch as real 2D (no 3D rendering) with exact classic Minesweeper logic.
- Launch scope: 2D mode, 3D mode, campaign of designed levels, local scores.
- Deferred, mentioned only: backend for global leaderboards, multiplayer, tournaments, events (minesweeper.online-style).
