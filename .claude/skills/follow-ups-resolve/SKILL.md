description: 'Act on a user reply to a numbered Follow-ups list: rewrite the list from the feedback until the user approves it, then execute it, delegating items to subagents. Trigger whenever the user answers such a list by number or as a whole — "do 1 and 3", "flip all eligible features to [DONE]", "ask me about 2 now", "fix it in place", "I will handle 4 myself, remove it" — whatever produced it: /follow-ups, a /runbook-run or /task-implement closing report, or any numbered list in that shape. Not for: a reply by the P<n> handle of a parked question, which answers that question; a new request unrelated to the list; producing a list, which is the job of /follow-ups.'

# /follow-ups-resolve
# Global skill: act on the user's reply to a numbered Follow-ups list. Not
# invoked by name — selected from the description above. Keeps one working
# list, rewrites it from the user's feedback until it is approved, then runs
# it: delegates items to subagents, relays their genuine questions, and brings
# every new follow-up back for approval. Beside a running /runbook-run it
# resolves and approves but defers execution to the run's end. Commits nothing
# of its own — each item commits the way the command it runs does.

THE POLICY
The interaction policy resolves from `--attended` / `--unattended` when the
reply carries one, a policy handed down by a parent run, and the project's
`CLAUDE.md`, per `../interaction-engine/references/policy.md`, which holds
their argument errors; under `unattended`, read
`../interaction-engine/references/gates.md`. Read
`../interaction-engine/references/messages.md` before printing the list —
the list, every relayed gate and every question follow it. The list's
approval is a `design` gate: it waits under either policy, and under
`unattended`, with nobody to answer, nothing executes. Every delegated prompt
hands the resolved policy down.

THE WORKING LIST
One list per conversation. It starts as the Follow-ups list the user replied
to, and every later reply rewrites it — never a second list beside it. Its
items are written the way `/follow-ups` § THE OUTPUT writes them.

The numbering is the reply handle: the list is numbered from 1 each time it
is printed, as one sequence, and a reply's numbers refer to the latest
printing.

Its output is the `Follow-ups` heading and the numbered items. Once any item
is approved, the items split into two sections under that heading —
**Approved** first, then **Awaiting approval** — the numbering running on
across both. An executed item leaves the list, its outcome reported in one
line; a list with no items left is the line `No follow-ups left`.

RESOLVE
The user's feedback rewrites the list: items that share an action are merged
into one, items the user takes on are removed, a question the user asks to be
asked is put now and its answer rewrites the item it belongs to, and a new
instruction becomes a new item. Print the rewritten list and wait. It is
re-presented after every reply until the user approves it. Gate class:
`design`.

Nothing executes before approval. A reply that says to execute named items
as printed — "do 1 and 3", "go" for the whole list — approves them; a reply
that changes an item approves nothing, and the rewritten item waits. Silence
is not approval.

EXECUTE
An approved item runs. This session orchestrates: it delegates each item to
a subagent, independent items in parallel and dependent ones in order, and
may do small work itself — a one-line fix in place. Each delegated prompt is
self-contained: the item, the decisions from this conversation it rests on,
and the gate rule below.

GATES
Every delegated prompt tells the subagent to auto-confirm an approval gate
that asks nothing but approval ("Approve and write?") and to surface, as it
usually would, any gate carrying a genuine question. The user's approval of
an item counts as the approval its gate asks for only while the gate's draft
stays inside that item: a draft that diverges from the design the item
states, or leaves a question open, is surfaced, and goes to the user.

The orchestrator never answers a gate raised to it — auto-mode policy may
refuse an agent answering on the user's behalf. It relays the gate to the
user — its question as asked, its draft as the subagent's plain summary,
the full draft on `show` — and the reply goes back to the subagent that
raised it.

NEW FOLLOW-UPS
A follow-up that arises during execution — named in a subagent's report, or
met by this session — goes to the user for approval, then joins the list. It
waits under **Awaiting approval** like any other item and never runs on its
own.

TASKS LAND IN A RUNBOOK
When the project has runbooks (`.claude/RUNBOOKS.md` exists), every task a
follow-up creates brings a companion item proposing the runbook and the
position it belongs at — `/runbook-create --append <runbook> --after <step>`
to put task <N> where its work falls. That item is part of the list like any
other: it is approved or rewritten, then executed. A task outside a runbook
drifts out of the implementation pipeline (`/follow-ups` § WHAT DOES NOT).

DURING A RUNBOOK RUN
While a `/runbook-run` is in flight, the user may resolve and approve items
under the rules above, but **nothing executes until the run ends** — not even
with the whole list approved. The list is printed on demand only:
`/follow-ups` invoked mid-run prints what has been collected so far, Approved
first, then Awaiting approval, and a reply that rewrites or approves items is
acknowledged in one line, never by re-printing the list. A follow-up that
arises mid-run is printed once, when it arises, as the one line `Follow-up:
<item>`, and joins the list under **Awaiting approval**. An approval moves the
items it names into **Approved**, merged with an item already there where they
share an action. A reply by a parked step's `P<n>` handle answers that step
and is never an approval here.

At the run's end the closing report's Follow-ups group carries the list — the
items still awaiting approval appear there, once, not in a second list after
it. After the report the approved items start executing, without waiting for
another reply, except an item whose precondition is an item still awaiting
approval: it waits until that one is approved and done.
