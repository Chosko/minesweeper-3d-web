description: Implement one or more tasks from the project's backlog end-to-end — tests first, status flipped in TASKS.md, one commit and one push per task, with optional review rounds and per-task subagents; `--unattended` parks a task at a question instead of halting the run. Use it once a task is written; stage 6 of the pipeline: turns a task body into code, the last stage.

# /task-implement
# Global skill: implement one or more tasks from the project's task backlog
# end-to-end, tests first, flipping each task's `Status:` in `TASKS.md` to
# `[IN PROGRESS]` and then `[DONE]`; one commit and push per task. Optional
# per-task subagents and review rounds; under `unattended` a question about
# the work parks the task (`[PARKED]`) and the run continues. Every run ends
# with one closing report — For the record, then one Follow-ups list.
# Usage: /task-implement <task-number> [<task-number> ...]
#        /task-implement all
#        /task-implement next
#        /task-implement <args> --no-commit   (run the tests-first flow, skip commits and pushes)
#        /task-implement <args> --no-push     (commit each task as usual, skip the pushes)
#        /task-implement <args> -y            (skip-tests mode: no per-task Proceed? prompt)
#        /task-implement <args> --agents      (2+ tasks: one fresh subagent per task, sequentially)
#        /task-implement <args> --no-agents   (2+ tasks: run everything in this conversation)
#        /task-implement <args> --review      (review each task before committing it)
#        /task-implement <args> --review --rounds N  (up to N review/iterate rounds; default 1)
#        /task-implement <args> --review --review-model <name>|same|auto   (reviewer's model; default auto)
#        /task-implement <args> --review --review-effort shallow|standard|deep|same|auto  (reviewer's read budget; default auto)
#        /task-implement <args> --unattended  (park a task at a question instead of halting; pre-ask the list's parked tasks first)
#        /task-implement <args> --unattended --skip-parked  (no pre-ask; a parked task with no answer is skipped)
#        /task-implement <args> --attended    (every gate waits, whatever CLAUDE.md says)
# Examples: /task-implement 12
#           /task-implement 12 13 14
#           /task-implement all
#           /task-implement next
#           /task-implement all --no-commit
#           /task-implement all --no-push
#           /task-implement all -y
#           /task-implement all -y --agents
#           /task-implement 12 --review
#           /task-implement 12 --review --rounds 3
#           /task-implement 12 --review --review-model sonnet
#           /task-implement 12 --review --review-model same
#           /task-implement all --review --review-effort shallow
#           /task-implement all --unattended
#           /task-implement all --unattended --skip-parked

GOAL
For each requested task, in the order given:
1. Flip status to `[IN PROGRESS]`.
2. Update or write tests to encode the spec.
3. Implement the production change.
4. Run the affected tests and watch them pass.
5. Run the full test suite and watch it pass.
6. Flip status to `[DONE]` (or `[PARTIAL]` / `[INCORRECT]` if appropriate).
7. Commit and push — one commit (and push) per task, skipped under
   `--no-commit`, the push alone under `--no-push`.

- Under `--review`, run a review/iterate loop between steps 5 and 6, on the
  uncommitted tree, so its fixes ride in the task's own single commit — see
  `./review-rounds.md`.
- Under UNATTENDED, a question about the work parks the task instead of
  halting the run — see PARKED TASKS.
- A step that fails and cannot be resolved by fixing the code stops the
  whole run — see FAILURE HANDLING.
- A completed task carrying a `Feature:` line may make its feature a
  completion candidate — see FEATURE COMPLETION.
- However the run ends, its last act is the closing report — see THE CLOSING
  REPORT and CLOSING THE RUN.

$ARGUMENTS

SHARED RULES (the `task-engine`)

- Eleven rules this skill shares with the rest of the `task-*` suite have
  exactly one authority each, under `../task-engine/references/`:
  - `resolution.md` — where the backlog lives and how a run resolves its
    task list;
  - `status.md` — the status vocabulary;
  - `targets.md` — the `Target:` values and the delegation guard;
  - `stale.md` — `[STALE]`;
  - `tree.md` — the dirty-tree protocol;
  - `commit.md` — commit and push gating;
  - `review-budget.md` — the review cost controls behind `--review-model` /
    `--review-effort`;
  - `testing-policy.md` — the testing-policy marker and how the test runner
    is resolved;
  - `tests-first.md` — the tests-first sequence, Steps 2–5;
  - `closing-report.md` — the closing report;
  - `parking.md` — task parking under the `unattended` policy, read only on
    the condition SUPPORTING FILES gives.
- Every one of them carries a `/task-implement` note holding this skill's
  own departures; the sections below cite them where they apply and state
  only what is this skill's own.

---

SUPPORTING FILES (read on demand — not up front)

- The common path is the whole of SKILL.md plus the interaction engine's
  `policy.md`, `messages.md` and `mode.md` and the task engine's
  `testing-policy.md`, `tests-first.md` and `closing-report.md`: a clean
  working tree, a project whose test command is already known, and numbered
  `Target: claude` tasks.
- Load everything else only when its branch actually applies — never
  speculatively:

| Read this file | Exactly when |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| `../interaction-engine/references/policy.md` | Every run, at ARGUMENT PARSING, to resolve the interaction policy. |
| `../interaction-engine/references/messages.md` | Every run, before its first question, gate or closing report. |
| `../interaction-engine/references/gates.md` | UNATTENDED is true (read at ARGUMENT PARSING). Never on an attended run. |
| `../task-engine/references/testing-policy.md` | Every run, at RESOLVING THE TEST RUNNER. |
| `../task-engine/references/tests-first.md` | Every task, at Step 2 (Step 3 when Steps 2, 4 and 5 are skipped). |
| `../task-engine/references/closing-report.md` | Every run, at THE CLOSING REPORT. |
| `../task-engine/references/test-runner.md` | Neither CLAUDE.md/README/`.claude/` nor a testing-policy marker names the test command, so you must infer it. |
| `../task-engine/references/no-test-suite.md` | The project has no test suite at all, OR CLAUDE.md declares `Testing policy for /task-implement: skip-tests`. |
| `./human-in-loop.md` | The current task's `Target:` is `claude+human` or `human`. |
| `./body-schemas.md`  | The task body does NOT match the current schema (Goal / Acceptance criteria / Decisions / Hints). |
| `../interaction-engine/references/mode.md` | Every run without `--no-agents`, at PRE-FLIGHT step 2b, to know whether orchestrate mode is on. |
| `./delegated-runs.md` | DELEGATE is true — the resolved list holds 2+ tasks and the user opted into per-task subagents (or passed `--agents`), or orchestrate mode is on (PRE-FLIGHT step 2b). Never otherwise on a single-task run, nor when the user declined or passed `--no-agents`. |
| `./review-rounds.md` | REVIEW is true — the run was invoked with `--review`. Read once, after ARGUMENT PARSING and before the first task. Never on a run without the flag. |
| `../task-engine/references/parking.md` | UNATTENDED is true (read at ARGUMENT PARSING, where its refusals apply), OR any task in the resolved list is `[PARKED]` (read at PRE-FLIGHT step 2). Never otherwise — an attended run that meets no parked task never opens it. |

- Throughout this skill, use Bash / PowerShell only for running tests and
  git commands.

---

ARGUMENT PARSING

Before resolving the task list, scan `$ARGUMENTS` for the flags below and
strip whichever appear; what is left is the task selector.

**Commit flags.**
- The `--commit`, `--no-commit` and `--no-push` flags, the mutual exclusion
  of the first two, and everything they gate are
  `../task-engine/references/commit.md`.
- NO_COMMIT true: perform the full test sequence and the `Status:` flips,
  but skip the per-task commit in Step 7 (see that step and BETWEEN TASKS).
  False — the default: commit each task separately.
- NO_PUSH true: skip the pull-at-start (PRE-FLIGHT step 5) and each task's
  re-sync/push in Step 7; every task still commits.

**`-y`.**
- If present, set AUTO_CONFIRM = true and strip it.
- AUTO_CONFIRM changes behavior only in skip-tests mode (see RESOLVING THE
  TEST RUNNER and `../task-engine/references/no-test-suite.md`): it
  suppresses the per-task "Proceed?" confirmation that mode would otherwise
  ask before each task.
- A `skip-tests-unattended` policy marker sets it for a whole run without
  the flag — `testing-policy.md` step 0 — and `-y` passed as well is
  redundant but harmless, never an error.

**`--agents` / `--no-agents`.**
- Strip whichever appears. They are mutually exclusive — if both appear,
  stop with: `--agents and --no-agents cannot be combined. Pick one.`
- They pre-answer PRE-FLIGHT step 2b's delegation question, which is then
  not asked: `--agents` sets DELEGATE = true, `--no-agents` sets
  DELEGATE = false. With neither flag, DELEGATE is undecided here and
  step 2b resolves it.
- Accept and ignore `--agents` on a run that resolves to fewer than 2 tasks
  — the run stays in-context, unless orchestrate mode is on (step 2b).

**Review flags.** Scan for the optional `--review` flag, the optional
`--rounds N` pair and the two `--review-*` flags, and strip whichever
appear:

- `--review` sets REVIEW = true. Default false. When it is true, read
  `./review-rounds.md` now — before the first task — and follow it for the
  rest of the run, starting with its availability gate.
- `--rounds N` sets ROUNDS = N, a positive integer; default 1. `--rounds`
  without `--review` stops the run with: `--rounds requires --review.` An
  `N` that is not a positive integer stops too:
  `--rounds needs a positive integer.`
- `--review-model <name>` sets REVIEW_MODEL; default `auto`. Its value is a
  model name or one of the two reserved words `same` and `auto`. **Accept
  any name verbatim** — there is no local allow-list; pass a name this
  skill does not recognise through to the Agent tool
  (`review-budget.md` § *Model names are not validated locally*).
  `--review-model` without `--review` stops the run with:
  `--review-model requires --review.`
- `--review-effort <level>` sets REVIEW_EFFORT; default `auto`. Legal values
  are exactly `shallow`, `standard`, `deep`, `same` and `auto`. Any other
  value stops the run with: `--review-effort must be one of: shallow,
  standard, deep, same, auto.` `--review-effort` without `--review` stops
  the run with: `--review-effort requires --review.`
- Both `--review-*` flags are plain strings here: what their values mean,
  how `auto` resolves, and what each effort level permits the reviewer to
  read are `../task-engine/references/review-budget.md`, which
  `./review-rounds.md` reads when REVIEW is true. Parsing resolves neither;
  never restate the `auto` tier table or the read budget in this skill.
- With REVIEW false, the default: neither value is ever resolved or used,
  `./review-rounds.md` is never opened, no loop runs, nothing new is asked,
  and the output says nothing about reviewing.

**Interaction-policy flags.** Scan for the optional `--attended`,
`--unattended` and `--skip-parked` flags and strip whichever appear.

- Resolve the run's interaction policy from the first two, a policy handed
  down by the parent run and the project's `CLAUDE.md`, per
  `../interaction-engine/references/policy.md`, which also holds their
  argument errors; read `CLAUDE.md` here if it has not been read yet.
- UNATTENDED is true when the policy resolves to `unattended`; under
  `attended`, nothing in this skill changes.
- `--skip-parked` sets SKIP_PARKED = true and suppresses PRE-FLIGHT step
  2a's pre-ask, for a launch no human sees — a routine, a scheduler, an
  orchestrator that is itself a subagent. `--skip-parked` on a run whose
  policy is not `unattended` stops the run with:
  `--skip-parked requires --unattended.`

When UNATTENDED is true:

- read `../task-engine/references/parking.md` now and apply its
  § *Refusals* before anything else, to a policy that came from the flag
  or from the parent: `--unattended` beside `--no-commit` stops the run,
  and so does a project whose `CLAUDE.md` carries a `## VCS` override
  (`commit.md`), each with the one-line message that section gives. A
  policy from the `CLAUDE.md` line is never refused: the run goes on, and a
  question that would park stops it instead, per
  `../interaction-engine/references/gates.md` § *A run that does not
  commit*.
- read `../interaction-engine/references/gates.md`; the class tag on each
  of this skill's gates applies.
- every prompt this run can raise that has a default takes it when it goes
  unanswered — a contract the session runs under, such as a runbook step's
  OPERATING RULES, answers it first — per `parking.md` § *Prompts with a
  default*, each value taken being one *For the record* line; the one
  prompt with none, an ambiguous test runner, aborts the run
  (`testing-policy.md` step 2). Only a question about the work parks a
  task, and only inside the per-task workflow (PER-TASK WORKFLOW
  § *Parking at a question*).

**Selectors.**
- After stripping the flags, `$ARGUMENTS` is a whitespace-separated list of
  task numbers, the literal token `all`, or the literal token `next`.
- What each selector resolves to, the eligibility clause the batch
  selectors honour, which statuses and blocked tasks they skip, the
  one-line resolution report printed without asking for confirmation, the
  naming of skipped stale tasks, and the empty-argument stop are
  `../task-engine/references/resolution.md` § *Selectors*.
- The human-intervention warning appended to an `all` / `next` resolution
  report is `../task-engine/references/targets.md`.

---

LOCATING THE BACKLOG

- Resolve the backlog per `../task-engine/references/resolution.md`. Its
  `/task-implement` note carries every way this skill departs from it: the
  wording of the not-initialised stop, that the selectors above are its
  argument form, and the precondition re-check in BETWEEN TASKS step 2.
- Read a body only when its task becomes the current one, never in bulk
  and never in advance (its § *Opening a per-task body file*).
- Write every `Status:` edit in `.claude/TASKS.md`, never in a body file
  (its § *Where a status flip is written*).

---

USING THE TASK BODY

- The current body schema is **Goal / Acceptance criteria / Decisions /
  Hints**. Read the body, then navigate CLAUDE.md, `.claude/context/`,
  `.claude/domain/`, and source files as needed.
- Use judgment about how much to read — the body's Hints point to the
  right files — not a checklist.
- If the body carries sections that do not match that schema — a `Context
  bundle` / `Implementation steps` pair, or the older `Description` /
  `Required reading` / `Out of scope` set — read `./body-schemas.md` for
  how to treat it.

**Consequential edits are in scope.**
- An edit that only makes a passage agree with a change already approved —
  by the task body, a user reply or a gate — and changes no meaning beyond
  it is this task's to make: in whatever file owns the passage, in this
  task's commit, whether or not the file is on `Files:`.
- Never ask about such an edit and never leave it as a follow-up; report it
  under *For the record* (THE CLOSING REPORT).
- This is how a Hint naming a document another pipeline command owns is
  edited: for the design change the body's `## Decisions` records as agreed
  and the points it records as settled, update every passage stating the
  old design.
- Leave untouched a passage whose update would introduce new meaning in an
  owned document, and list it under *Follow-ups* as a precise follow-up —
  the command, the anchor and the passages,
  `/architect amend feature=<slug> "<change>"` — never a vague pointer at
  the owner.

---

DOCUMENTATION-ONLY TASKS

- In full test mode (a project with a real test suite, no skip-tests
  marker), Steps 2, 4, and 5 normally run for every task.
- Step 1 sets DOC_ONLY per task — silently, with no confirmation prompt —
  from data already in hand at that point: the `Files:` field noted in
  PRE-FLIGHT step 2 and the body just read. This is not a separate re-read
  pass.
- A task is documentation-only when EVERY path in its `Files:` field is a
  documentation artifact — `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/**`, or a
  comparable prose/reference file — and NONE is a source file, script, test
  file, or a command/skill specification (`commands/*.md`, `skills/**/*.md`,
  or the equivalent executable-prompt files in another project). Those look
  like markdown but define runtime behavior, so editing them is a code
  change, not a documentation change.
- If `Files:` is empty, ambiguous, or mixes documentation with any
  non-documentation path, the task is a normal code task — never guess in
  the direction of skipping tests.
- When DOC_ONLY is true, skip Steps 2, 4, and 5 for this task exactly as
  in skip-tests mode, where they are already skipped for every task.

---

STALE TASKS

- What `[STALE]` means, who sets and clears it, and the implement-anyway /
  stop warning to put to the user before touching such a task — including
  where the feature slug comes from and what each answer does — are
  `../task-engine/references/stale.md` § *Implementing a stale task*.
- Its `/task-implement` note carries the rest of this skill's half: the
  choice is always the user's, and a stale task is never delegated to a
  subagent.
- Run it before reading anything else on a `[STALE]` task, and do not
  continue unless the user explicitly chose to implement it anyway.

---

PARKED TASKS

- What `[PARKED]` means, the one event that parks a task, the handoff and
  the branch a park leaves behind, the park sequence, the unpark
  transaction, when an unpark is attempted and the two refusals are
  `../task-engine/references/parking.md`.
- Its `/task-implement` note names the rest as this skill's own, each in
  this body: the `--unattended` flag and UNATTENDED's resolution (ARGUMENT
  PARSING), the pre-ask (PRE-FLIGHT step 2a), the park and the unpark
  (PER-TASK WORKFLOW), the chat handle and the in-memory answers (BETWEEN
  TASKS step 2a).
- On a delegated run the agent parks and the launcher records the
  `[PARKED]` return — or, under attended, relays the agent's question
  instead — per `./delegated-runs.md`.
- Read `parking.md` on the condition SUPPORTING FILES gives — never on an
  attended run that meets no `[PARKED]` task.

---

RESOLVING THE TEST RUNNER

Before anything else, establish how tests run, per
`../task-engine/references/testing-policy.md` — the
`Testing policy for /task-implement:` marker first, then project
convention, then inference, then the no-test-suite branch, and which tests
count as affected. Its `/task-implement` note carries this skill's half.

---

PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS (before any task)

1. **Working-tree check.** Run the dirty-tree protocol from
   `../task-engine/references/tree.md`:
   `git status --porcelain` once, silent continuation on a clean tree, its
   prompt when the output is non-empty. It sets DIRTY_FOLD and
   DIRTY_FOLD_UNTRACKED, which Step 7 consumes, and may halt the run. Its
   `/task-implement` note carries this skill's specifics: the check runs
   twice (here and in BETWEEN TASKS), what `--no-commit` does to the second
   one, and a delegated agent is handed the parent's decision and must not
   re-run the prompt.

2. Use the Read tool to open `.claude/TASKS.md`. Resolve the task list
   per ARGUMENT PARSING above. For each task to be implemented:
   - Confirm a summary block for that task ID exists in TASKS.md. An ID
     requested by number that has none is archived and terminal, per
     `resolution.md` § *The archive*. Stop the run before any task starts,
     without opening anything:

     > Task <N> is not in `.claude/TASKS.md` — it has been archived. Its
     > body would be at `.claude/tasks/archive/<N>.md`; ask to read it if
     > you want it. An archived task is not implemented again — follow-up
     > work is a new task (`/task-add`).

     Open that file only if the user then asks to read it, and never
     re-implement the task.
   - Confirm its status is implementable.
     `../task-engine/references/status.md` § *Implementable* is which
     statuses those are and what to do when a task requested explicitly by
     number carries another one — including the `[STALE]` hand-off to
     STALE TASKS above and the `[PARKED]` unpark of PARKED TASKS above.
     (For `all` and `next`, the other statuses are skipped — see ARGUMENT
     PARSING.)
   - Keep a `[PARKED]` task in the resolved list under either policy:
     whether an answerer exists is decided when it is reached (Step 1),
     after the pre-ask, and a task with none is skipped there with one
     line. If any resolved task is `[PARKED]`, read
     `../task-engine/references/parking.md` now.
   - Note its Files, Preconditions, and — when present — `Feature:`
     fields from the summary block. `Feature:` appears only on
     feature-derived tasks; its absence is normal.

   This is the one read of the summary blocks for the whole run. It holds
   the three fields the delegation guard needs — `Target:`, `Status:` and
   `Feature:` — so nothing about delegation is decided by opening a body,
   and on a delegated run the parent never opens `.claude/tasks/<N>.md` for
   a delegated task (`./delegated-runs.md` § *What the parent never
   reads*).

2a. **Pre-ask.** Only when UNATTENDED is true and SKIP_PARKED is false;
   otherwise skip this step — an attended run asks each parked task's
   question when it reaches the task (Step 1), after the user has seen the
   earlier tasks' outcomes. With no `[PARKED]` task in the resolved list,
   print nothing.

   - After the resolution report, open the trailing `## Parking handoff` of
     each `[PARKED]` task's body — for its `Parked:` and `Question:` lines
     only, the body's one pre-flight read — and print one block, one item
     per parked task in list order, each under its handle:

     > Some tasks in this run stopped earlier on a question. Answer each by
     > its handle (`P1: Q1a, Q2b`), or `skip P2` / `skip all`:
     >
     > P1. Add the session timeout — stopped while implementing
     >     (task 42, parked 2026-09-23 at Step 3)
     >     <its `Question:`, verbatim and multi-line, options included>
     > P2. Add the login form — its draft waits for approval, which only a
     >     run you watch can give, with the draft in front of you; skip-only
     >     here (task 47, parked 2026-09-23 at the review round)

   - Wait for a reply. Hold each answer in run memory for its task and feed
     it to the unpark in Step 1 — nothing on disk changes, so a run that
     dies loses them and the next launch asks again.
   - List an `approval gate` item skip-only, per `parking.md` § *The unpark
     transaction*; reject an answer to one with one line and record
     nothing.
   - Silence, EOF or an unrelated reply is `skip all` — the value
     `--skip-parked` gives. Nothing parks here: a pre-flight prompt has no
     current task.
   - The `P<n>` handles are the run's question handles, one sequence for
     the whole run: a task parked later in this run takes the next unused
     handle, and BETWEEN TASKS reads replies against them. Accept any reply
     that names the handle and leaves no doubt which answer goes to which
     `Q<n>` (`parking.md` § *The one event that parks*).

2b. **Delegation check.**
   - If `--no-agents` was passed, DELEGATE is already false; don't ask.
   - Otherwise, when orchestrate mode is on — the check in
     `../interaction-engine/references/mode.md` — DELEGATE is true for any
     resolved list, a single task included, and nothing is asked.
   - With the mode off, this step runs only when the resolved list holds 2
     or more tasks. With fewer than 2, DELEGATE is false, nothing is asked
     and the run stays in-context — skip the rest of this step.
   - If `--agents` was passed, DELEGATE is already set; don't ask.
     Otherwise ask once:

     > This run covers <k> tasks. Implement each one in a fresh subagent, so
     > later tasks don't inherit the context of earlier ones? Agents run one
     > after another, never in parallel.
     >
     > A. **Yes** — one agent per task, sequentially.
     > B. **No** — implement everything in this conversation.

   - Wait for an explicit answer. Silence, an unclear reply, or EOF means
     B — in-context.
   - If DELEGATE is true, read `./delegated-runs.md` now and follow it for
     the rest of the run. Which tasks may never be handed to a subagent is
     the delegation guard in `../task-engine/references/targets.md`;
     `./delegated-runs.md` governs how the resulting split is announced and
     executed, what the fixed-size agent prompt carries, and what each
     agent returns.

3. If the project has a CLAUDE.md, read it — it's small and global.
   Defer reading the broader `.claude/context/` and `.claude/domain/`
   layers until per-task Step 1 indicates a need (see USING THE TASK
   BODY). Don't assume any of these exist.

4. Briefly tell the user what you're about to do — one line per task —
   then start. When DELEGATE is true, that summary also says which tasks
   go to agents and which run in this conversation (see
   `./delegated-runs.md`).

5. **Pull at start**, per `../task-engine/references/commit.md`
   § *Pull at start* — here once per invocation, before the first task's
   work begins, with each task's own re-sync happening right before that
   task's push (Step 7).

---

PER-TASK WORKFLOW

For each task, in order.

When DELEGATE is true, each spawned agent performs this workflow for its
one task; the parent runs it directly only for the tasks
`./delegated-runs.md` keeps in the parent (`claude+human`, `human`, and
explicitly requested `[STALE]` tasks). The steps are identical either way,
and Step 1's body read happens in whichever session is implementing the
task, never in both.

### Parking at a question   [only when UNATTENDED is true]

- A question about the work is an acceptance criterion this task cannot
  settle from the body and the codebase, or a `--review` round's approval
  gate.
- Under attended, put it to the user and wait; a delegated agent puts it to
  its launcher under `QUESTIONS FOR USER`, and the launcher relays it
  (`./delegated-runs.md` § *The question relay*).
- Under UNATTENDED, park the task instead: run the park sequence from
  `parking.md`, the step reached being the one the handoff's `Parked:`
  names, the question recorded verbatim there and printed in chat under
  the next `P<n>` handle (PRE-FLIGHT step 2a).
- The base tree is clean afterwards, so go to BETWEEN TASKS as if the task
  had committed, and continue with the next task.

### Step 1 — Mark IN PROGRESS

1. If this task's status is `[STALE]`, run the STALE TASKS protocol before
   reading anything else.
2. If this task's status is `[PARKED]`, decide the answerer first, per
   `parking.md` § *The answerer rule*: an attended session, or an answer
   held for this task from the pre-ask or a chat reply (BETWEEN TASKS).
   - With none — which only an UNATTENDED run can meet — skip the task with
     that section's one line and go to BETWEEN TASKS: no branch is touched
     and no commit is made. A held `skip` is the same skip.
   - With an answerer, run the unpark transaction from `parking.md`; once
     it succeeds, read the body as below, flip the status as below, remove
     the `## Parking handoff` section from the body, and continue this
     workflow at the step `Parked:` names, the answer in hand. Both edits
     ride in Step 7's commit, which stages the body file on this one path
     (`commit.md`).
   - A cherry-pick conflict follows `parking.md` § *The unpark
     transaction*: under UNATTENDED the task stays `[PARKED]` and is
     skipped after the bookkeeping commit; under attended the run halts and
     asks how to merge.
3. Use the Read tool to open `.claude/tasks/<N>.md` for the current task.
   Hold its contents in mind for the rest of the per-task workflow.
4. What each `Target:` value means at implementation time is
   `../task-engine/references/targets.md` § *At implementation time*. If
   the target is `claude+human` or `human`, read `./human-in-loop.md` now
   and follow it for the rest of this task; it decides whether a tool
   connected this session drives a checkpoint.
5. Apply the body schema guidance from USING THE TASK BODY above, and
   DOCUMENTATION-ONLY TASKS to set DOC_ONLY for this task.
6. Use the Edit tool to change this task's `Status:` line in
   `.claude/TASKS.md` (the summary block) to `[IN PROGRESS]`. Do not
   commit this change yet — it will be bundled into the task's commit.

### Steps 2–5 — Tests first, implement, run the suite

- Follow `../task-engine/references/tests-first.md` for this task — Step 2
  updates the tests, Step 3 implements, Step 4 runs the affected tests and
  Step 5 the full suite, with Steps 2, 4 and 5 skipped as that file says.
  Its `/task-implement` note says what the specification, the declared
  files and "documentation-only" are here.
- On a `claude+human` or `human` task, apply the checkpoint protocol from
  `./human-in-loop.md` at each checkpoint's trigger point during Step 3.

### Review rounds   [only when REVIEW is true]

- If REVIEW is false — the default — there is nothing here; go straight to
  Step 6.
- Otherwise run the review/iterate loop from `./review-rounds.md`, which
  was read before the first task, on this task's still-uncommitted tree:
  1. Spawn `/task-review` as a subagent.
  2. **Wait for its findings to arrive** (the Agent call returns an id, not
     the report).
  3. Run `/task-iterate` in this session, telling it not to commit.
  4. Repeat while `BLOCKING` findings remain and rounds are left, up to
     ROUNDS.
- Do not reach Step 6 or Step 7 until the final round's reviewer result
  has actually arrived.
- Unresolved `BLOCKING` findings after the last round stop the run — see
  FAILURE HANDLING.

### Step 6 — Mark DONE (or other terminal status)

- Use the Edit tool to update this task's `Status:` line in
  `.claude/TASKS.md`. The default is `[DONE]`.
- Which terminal statuses this skill may write, and when, is
  `../task-engine/references/status.md` — its `/task-implement` note
  carries this skill's half: it is the only consumer that writes
  `[IN PROGRESS]` and `[DONE]`, `[PARTIAL]` is used only for a
  sub-requirement discovered during implementation that belongs in a
  separate task (surface it to the user before choosing that status), and
  `[INCORRECT]` never appears on a fresh implementation.
- If this task's TASKS.md summary block carries a `Feature: <slug>` line
  and the status just written is `[DONE]`, apply the FEATURE COMPLETION
  check below before moving to Step 7.

### Step 7 — Commit and push   [skipped in --no-commit mode]

- Commit and push gating — flags, staging by explicit path, commit count,
  the push protocol, commit and push failures — is
  `../task-engine/references/commit.md`. Its `/task-implement` note carries
  this skill's specifics: one commit per task and one push immediately
  after it, the commit
  message format and its skip-tests parenthetical, exactly what this step
  stages, the fold when DIRTY_FOLD is true, both deliberate departures from
  the one-commit rule (the `--review` loop's fixes and the FEATURE
  COMPLETION flip), and why a push failure here is not an ordinary failure.
- If NO_COMMIT is true, do not commit (or push) this task. Leave all files
  modified by this task — including the `.claude/TASKS.md` status flip —
  uncommitted in the working tree, and move on to the next task (or the
  closing report); each task's changes accumulate uncommitted across the
  run. Skip the rest of this step.
- Otherwise (the default), stage this task's own paths, commit once, report
  the resulting hash, and — unless NO_PUSH is true — re-sync and push, all
  per `commit.md`. DIRTY_FOLD, set by the dirty-tree check, decides whether
  the pre-existing dirty changes are folded in here; the fold itself is
  `tree.md` § *Folding in Step 7*.
- A task unparked from a branch ends with that branch's deletion, after
  this step's commit and push — `parking.md` § *The unpark transaction*,
  step 4.

---

BETWEEN TASKS

When DELEGATE is true, follow `./delegated-runs.md` § *Between delegated
tasks* instead of the list below for delegated tasks — the same ground plus
verifying what the returning agent did; a task the parent implements
itself follows the list as usual. Step 2a is the parent's under
either: the chat is the launcher's own, and an answered task's agent is
spawned next.

After committing — or, under UNATTENDED, parking or skipping — a task,
before starting the next:
1. Run the dirty-tree check again, exactly as PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS step 1 did,
   per `tree.md`; DIRTY_FOLD set there applies to the upcoming task's
   Step 7. **In --no-commit mode, skip this check entirely** — the previous
   task's changes are deliberately left uncommitted and will accumulate, so
   a non-empty `git status` is expected, not a surprise.
2. Use the Read tool to re-open `.claude/TASKS.md` fresh: IDs are stable,
   but statuses or `Preconditions:` may have changed — a parallel
   `/task-add` or `/task-clean`, or an earlier task in this run landing
   `[PARTIAL]` rather than `[DONE]`.
   - On a run whose list was resolved by `all`, re-check the upcoming
     task's `Preconditions:` against this re-read, per clause 2 of
     `resolution.md` § *Eligibility*. If they no longer hold, skip the task
     with one line — "Skipping task 14 — its preconditions no longer hold
     (waits on 12)." — and apply this step to the task after it. The
     re-check uses only the file this step already re-reads.
   - Never re-check an explicit-number list: a task requested by number is
     never blocked by a precondition.
2a. Read any chat message that arrived since the previous task started.
   - A reply by `P<n>` handle to a question printed this run — at the
     pre-ask or at a park — or one naming that question's task, is the
     task's answer: record it in run memory and move the task to the front
     of the remaining list, so Step 1 unparks it next.
   - Any other message is ordinary conversation, and the run continues.
   - Reject with one line, recording nothing, a reply naming a handle this
     run never printed, a second answer to a question already answered, or
     an answer to an `approval gate` item — the set is `parking.md`
     § *The answerer rule*'s, and the first answer wins. A pre-ask `skip`
     holds no answer, so a later reply by that number is the question's
     first.
3. Briefly report progress: "Task N committed. Starting task M." — or, for
   a task that did not commit, "Task N parked (question 3). Starting task
   M." / "Task N skipped — parked, no answer held. Starting task M."
4. In skip-tests mode, ask "Proceed?" before starting the next task,
   unless AUTO_CONFIRM is true or UNATTENDED is true —
   `../task-engine/references/no-test-suite.md`.
   Gate class: `confirmation`.

---

FEATURE COMPLETION

Applies only to tasks whose TASKS.md summary block carries a `Feature:
<slug>` line — free-form tasks never trigger this.

**The check.**
- When Step 6 lands a task at `[DONE]` and it carries `Feature: <slug>`,
  check every other summary block in `.claude/TASKS.md` that carries the
  same `Feature: <slug>`.
- If every one of them is now `[DONE]` or `[SKIP]`, AND
  `.claude/FEATURES.md`'s entry for `<slug>` currently reads `Status:
  [PLANNED]`, record `<slug>` as a completion candidate in memory for the
  rest of the run. This is the only outcome of the check — do not propose
  anything yet, and do not re-check a slug already recorded.
- A `[PARTIAL]` task never triggers this check, even if it carries a
  `Feature:` line.
- Only a `[PLANNED]` feature can become a candidate: one whose
  `FEATURES.md` status is `[NEW]`, `[ITERATED]` or already `[DONE]` never
  does — including a feature a human marked `[DONE]` by hand. This
  proposal is the only place `/task-implement` itself writes that status, and it never
  overwrites a status a human already set.
- Run the check wherever a task's terminal status becomes visible to the
  parent: at the end of Step 6 for a task the parent implemented itself,
  and during the delegated-run "re-read TASKS.md" step
  (`./delegated-runs.md`) for a task a subagent implemented. Either way the
  parent accumulates the candidate list across the whole run.

**A nested run never proposes** — under a delegated agent, or a runbook
step whose prompt ends with `OPERATING RULES`, the proposal belongs to the
outermost run. A runbook step names each candidate in its `DONE` report,
one line; a delegated agent names none — the launcher derives them from
`TASKS.md`.

**Propose once, at the very end of the run** — after the last requested
task's Step 7 (or Step 6, under `--no-commit`), never mid-run even on a
many-task batch.
- If the candidate list is empty, say nothing about this at all.
- Gate class: `confirmation` — under UNATTENDED the proposal passes on its
  own: every candidate is approved, flipped and committed as below, and the
  closing report names the commit.
- Otherwise, present every candidate together:

> Every task of Password authentication is now done or skipped, so the
> feature itself is finished. Mark it done in the feature list?
> (password-auth, tasks 31–35)

or, with more than one candidate:

> Every task of these features is now done or skipped:
>
>   Password authentication (password-auth, tasks 31–35)
>   Session handling (session-handling, tasks 36–37)
>
> Mark them done in the feature list — all, none, or the ones you name?

- Wait for an explicit answer; silence is not approval and leaves every
  candidate `[PLANNED]`. A slug the user declines, or doesn't name, stays
  `[PLANNED]` — mention that in the closing report, but don't ask again
  this run.
- For each slug the user approves, use the Edit tool to change that entry's
  `Status:` line in `.claude/FEATURES.md` to `[DONE]`. Nothing else in the
  entry changes and no per-task commit is touched.
- If NO_COMMIT is true, leave the edited `.claude/FEATURES.md` uncommitted
  alongside the run's other uncommitted changes, same as Step 7. Otherwise,
  if at least one slug was approved, give this flip its own commit and push
  — the second of the two deliberate departures from the one-commit rule
  that `commit.md`'s `/task-implement` note records, with the message form
  it gives there.

---

THE CLOSING REPORT

- Every run ends with one closing report — at completion, at a failure
  halt and at a stop the user asked for alike.
- Its two groups, *For the record* and *Follow-ups*, their shapes, the
  empty-group form and the numbering as the reply handle are
  `../task-engine/references/closing-report.md`. Its `/task-implement` note
  carries this skill's own items, the review-pair line, the `P<n>` handles
  of parked tasks, the order after FEATURE COMPLETION and the rendering
  under `--agents`.

---

CLOSING THE RUN

**The closing report is the last thing a run does.**
- Its *Follow-ups* group is where the `/follow-ups` command's rules are
  applied — **once per run, never per task** — inside the report, not as a
  call after it.
- Never invoke the command: read its body by name and apply its rules to
  the run's reading, so what they yield folds into one list with the run's
  own items, under one numbering. What counts as a follow-up, what is
  excluded and how an item is written are that body's alone; never restate
  them.
- Give the report **after** the FEATURE COMPLETION proposal, never before:
  that proposal can itself leave something unresolved — a slug the user
  declined stays `[PLANNED]`.
- Give it at every point a run stops, not only at completion:
  - after the last task in the run, whatever the run resolved to
    (`<N>...`, `all`, `next`);
  - at a failure halt, per FAILURE HANDLING — including a `--review` loop
    that ended with unresolved `BLOCKING` findings;
  - when the user asks to stop between tasks.
  A single-task run is not a special case: the end of the one task is the
  end of the run.

**Under `--agents`.**
- The parent's reading covers the per-agent result reports it already
  collects — the six-field returns in `./delegated-runs.md` — as well as
  its own conversation. It opens nothing new to do it.
- A `[PARKED]` return is not a failure halt: the run goes on to its last
  task and the report comes at the end as usual.
- Each agent's fifth field holds at most three follow-ups it found by
  applying the `/follow-ups` command's rules to its own session, or nothing
  (`./delegated-runs.md` § *What the agent returns, and what the parent
  keeps*).
- Fold the lines it does return into the *Follow-ups* group, attributed to
  the task they came from. They are the agent's claim on work the parent
  never saw: pass them through as stated — do not re-word them into a
  judgement the parent cannot support, and do not drop one because it looks
  unlikely. Most tasks return none.
- The rest of the group still comes from the launcher's own conversation —
  the delegation split, tasks skipped for unmet preconditions, failure
  lines, declined feature slugs.
- When a listed follow-up from a delegated agent is executed or planned,
  forwarding it to that same agent is allowed and often convenient — a
  judgement call, not a relay protocol.

**It changes no bookkeeping.** The report adds no commit and flips no
status; print it after every per-task commit and after any FEATURE
COMPLETION commit.

**When `/follow-ups` is not installed, the group holds the run's own items
only, silently.** `requires: command:follow-ups` normally installs it; a
user who removed it by hand gets no message and no error. An absent
optional rule set is not a run failure.

---

FAILURE HANDLING

If any step fails in a way you cannot resolve:
- Do not commit a broken task.
- Do not flip the status to `[DONE]`.
- Leave the task's status in `.claude/TASKS.md` as `[IN PROGRESS]` so
  the user can see where the run stopped.
- Stop the entire run — do not start subsequent tasks.
- Report clearly what failed, what you tried, and what the user might
  want to do next (revert with `git restore`, fix manually, edit the
  task spec).
- Then give the closing report, its *Follow-ups* group included, per
  CLOSING THE RUN.

Cases:
- **A failure inside a delegated task** is not a special case: the parent
  stops the run without spawning the next agent, and reports as
  `./delegated-runs.md` § *Failure* says.
- **Unresolved `BLOCKING` findings at the end of a `--review` loop** are an
  ordinary case of this: the task never reaches Step 6, so its status stays
  `[IN PROGRESS]`, its tree stays uncommitted, and the run stops with the
  findings reported by id. See `./review-rounds.md`.
- **A Step 7 push failure or pre-push conflict** is a distinct case
  (`commit.md`'s `/task-implement` note): the commit already succeeded,
  so nothing is reverted and no status is flipped back. Stop the entire run the same way, and report that this
  task's commit exists locally and needs a manual sync + push before
  resuming with the remaining tasks.
- **A park that cannot make its branch** — a leftover branch it cannot
  delete, the push refused — is a Step 7 failure of that kind, per
  `parking.md` § *The park sequence*: task `[IN PROGRESS]`, tree intact,
  run stopped.
- **Not failures:** a parked task — in this conversation or as a delegated
  agent's `[PARKED]` return, which the launcher records before spawning the
  next agent — and an unpark whose cherry-pick conflicts: it rolls back,
  and Step 1 says what each policy does next.

Never run destructive git operations (`reset --hard`, `clean -f`,
`checkout .`) without the user's explicit instruction.

Never write a `Feature:` line into any task. It is `/task-add`'s field; this
skill only reads it.
