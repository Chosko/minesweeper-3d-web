description: Write the production plan into .claude/PLAN.md — which low-level feature belongs to which milestone, in what order and after what — confirming each feature's dependency edges with the user. Use it once features are architected and before their tasks are written; stage 4 of the pipeline: sequences feature documents into a plan; its output is what /production-status reads.

# /production-plan
# Global skill: decide which low-level feature belongs to which milestone, in
# what order, and after what — and write it down as `.claude/PLAN.md`, a
# third index beside `TASKS.md` and `FEATURES.md`. Stage 4 of the pipeline:
# sequences the feature documents `/architect` wrote, ahead of `/task-add`.
# Inherits each feature's milestone from the parenthetical on its
# `FEATURES.md` `Source:` line, turns each feature document's Dependencies
# prose into a confirmed edge list, and refuses a dependency cycle and a
# feature scheduled before something it needs. Re-runnable: a later run
# reconciles the plan against the current `FEATURES.md` and roadmap behind
# one approval gate. Requires `/domain-setup`; a roadmap is optional —
# without one every feature lands in Unscheduled and dependency ordering
# still works. Sole writer of `PLAN.md`; reads `FEATURES.md`, the feature
# documents, the roadmap and `TASKS.md` and writes none of them. Commits and
# pushes exactly what the run wrote by default.
# Usage: /production-plan                        (build or reconcile the plan)
#        /production-plan <free-form context>    (placements, orderings, what is active now)
#        /production-plan amend "<change>"       (reconcile only the features, edges or milestones the change names)
#        /production-plan --no-commit            (write the plan, run no git command)
#        /production-plan --no-push              (commit the plan, skip the push)
#        /production-plan <args> --attended | --unattended

GOAL

- Produce **one ordered plan**: place every architected feature in a
  milestone or in `Unscheduled`, and order each milestone's feature list.
  **That order is the priority** — keep no second priority axis, no
  `P0`/`P1` label, nothing that could contradict the list.
- Turn the `## Dependencies` prose every feature document carries into a
  **machine-readable edge list** the plan stores.
- Refuse the two arrangements that cannot be built: a dependency cycle, and
  a feature scheduled before something it needs.
- Stay at **feature-level scheduling, not design and not implementation**.
  How a feature is built is `/architect`'s; what its tasks are is
  `/task-add`'s.
- Read [`.claude/domain/product-workflow.md`](../../.claude/domain/product-workflow.md)
  in the target project if it has one; this skill is a stage of the pipeline
  that document describes.

$ARGUMENTS

---

SUPPORTING FILES (read on demand — not up front)

| Read this file | Exactly when |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| `../interaction-engine/references/policy.md` | Every run, at ARGUMENT PARSING, to resolve the interaction policy. |
| `../interaction-engine/references/messages.md` | Every run, before the first question, gate or closing report — every one of them follows it. |
| `../interaction-engine/references/gates.md` | The policy resolved to `unattended`. |
| `./reconciling.md` | PHASE 0 finds `.claude/PLAN.md` already exists. Read before PHASE 1 — it carries the five-situation re-run protocol. |
| `./amend.md` | ARGUMENT PARSING recognised `amend "<change>"`. Read once PHASE 0's gate has passed; it carries the whole amend path — a reconciliation narrowed to what the change names — and replaces every phase for the run. |

A first run — no `PLAN.md` yet — reads neither this table's file nor
anything else beyond `SKILL.md`.

---

ARGUMENT PARSING

1. **`--no-commit`.** If present, set COMMIT = false and strip it; otherwise
   COMMIT is true — this skill commits and pushes what it wrote by default.
   `--no-commit` implies NO_PUSH: nothing is committed, so nothing is there
   to push.
   - Accept and strip `--commit`; it is a silent no-op naming the default.
   - If both `--commit` and `--no-commit` appear, stop with:
     `--commit and --no-commit cannot be combined. Pick one.`
2. **`--no-push`.** Strip it. NO_PUSH only matters when COMMIT is true: it
   skips the pull-at-start / re-sync / push steps of the commit-and-push
   protocol while still committing as always.
3. **`--attended` / `--unattended`.** Strip whichever appear. Resolve the
   run's interaction policy from them, a policy handed down by a parent run
   and the project's `CLAUDE.md`, per
   `../interaction-engine/references/policy.md`, which holds their argument
   errors.
   - Each gate carries its class tag
     (`../interaction-engine/references/gates.md`).
   - This skill cannot park: a run that stops on what waits — an edge to
     confirm, a milestone-status question included — writes nothing.
4. **`amend`.** If what remains opens with the literal token `amend`
   followed by a quoted change, set AMEND = true; the change is the quoted
   string.
   - A missing change stops the run with
     `amend needs the change to make, e.g. /production-plan amend "unschedule crawler-opt-out-page".`
   - Once PHASE 0's gate has passed and the pull-at-start has run, read
     `./amend.md` and follow it for the rest of the run. No phase runs — the
     arm carries what it needs of PHASE 0's read and PHASE 2's validation —
     and the run ends with COMMIT AND PUSH as any other does.
5. **Free-form context.** Otherwise, whatever remains is context about the
   plan — a feature the user wants placed in a particular milestone, an
   ordering they want, which milestone is being built now, a milestone they
   consider shipped. Fold it into PHASE 1; do not treat it as a command.

Maintain a `WRITTEN` list of every path this invocation wrote. It drives the
final report and the optional commit.

---

PHASE 0 — GATE + READ

1. **Gate.** Probe `.claude/FEATURES.md` (Read). If it is missing, stop:

   > This project has no feature index. Run `/domain-setup` first — it creates
   > `.claude/domain/`, the domain `INDEX.md`, and `.claude/FEATURES.md`. Then
   > architect at least one feature with `/architect`, and re-run
   > `/production-plan`.

   Do not proceed and do not create the index yourself. No exceptions. This
   is the only gate in the skill.
2. **Do not require a roadmap.** `.claude/domain/product-roadmap.md` is an
   optional input. Without it every feature lands in `Unscheduled`, and
   dependency edges and cycle validation still work. When it is absent, say
   so in one line and carry on; never warn, never refuse, and never point at
   `/product-roadmap` as a prerequisite.
3. **Pull at start.** If COMMIT is true and the project's CLAUDE.md does not
   carry a `## VCS` override (non-git), pull per the commit-and-push
   protocol: run `git pull` on the current branch. A conflict stops the run
   here — report the conflict output and tell the user to resolve manually
   and re-run.
4. **Read the inputs**, in this order. Every one is **read-only** — this
   skill writes `.claude/PLAN.md` and nothing else, ever:
   1. `.claude/FEATURES.md` — every feature slug, its `Status:`, its
      `Source:` line (including the optional ` (<milestone-slug>)`
      parenthetical), and its `Tasks:` line.
   2. Each feature document named by a `Doc:` line — its `## Dependencies`
      section only, the input to PHASE 1's edge proposal.
   3. `.claude/domain/product-roadmap.md`, **if present** — the milestone
      slugs, their order (list position, top to bottom), and their `Covers:`
      lines.
   4. `.claude/PLAN.md`, if present — the existing plan and the run's resume
      state: a re-run proposes changes *against* it rather than from a blank
      page. If it exists, read `./reconciling.md` before PHASE 1.
   5. `.claude/TASKS.md` — task statuses, **only** to decide whether to
      propose a milestone as `[SHIPPED]` in PHASE 1. Nothing else in this
      skill reads or depends on task state.
5. **No features at all** — `FEATURES.md` exists but lists none: write
   nothing, say so in one line ("No features are architected yet — run
   `/architect` first; there is nothing to plan."), and stop. This is not a
   refusal and not an error.
6. Say in two or three lines what you found — first run or reconciliation,
   how many features, how many milestones (or that there is no roadmap) —
   then continue.

---

PHASE 1 — PLACE, CONNECT, DECIDE

Assemble the whole proposal in one conversational round. Contribute rather
than only extract: propose the placement and the ordering with reasons, and
say what looks wrong.

**1. Milestone inheritance — a lookup, not an inference.** For each feature
in `FEATURES.md`, read its `Source:` line:

- `Source: product-design.md § <Section> (<milestone-slug>)` → the feature
  belongs to `<milestone-slug>`. Take it directly; do not re-derive it from
  the section name, the roadmap's `Covers:` prose, the shape of its
  document, or anything else.
- No parenthetical, or `Source: prompt` → the feature starts in
  `Unscheduled` until placed by hand.
- A parenthetical naming a milestone the roadmap does not have → place the
  feature there anyway and say so in one line. A hand-edited or
  ahead-of-the-roadmap `Source:` must not break the run.
- **Explicit placement overrides the parenthetical.** The user may place any
  feature in any milestone — from `$ARGUMENTS` or in this conversation — and
  that placement wins. Never gate and never refuse an override; **report it
  plainly** at the approval gate, naming the feature, the milestone its
  `Source:` implies, and the milestone it is being placed in. Never apply it
  silently.

**2. Ordering within each milestone.** `Features:` is ordered and the order
is the priority.

- Propose an order consistent with the dependency edges (step 3) and, where
  the edges leave a choice, with what unblocks the most work first.
- Say which constraint is driving each placement.
- On a reconciliation, start from the existing order and discuss only the
  delta.
- Do not invent a priority field, a `P0`/`P1` label, a size, an estimate, or
  a date. If the user asks for a priority, the answer is a position in the
  list.

**3. Dependency edges — documents propose, `PLAN.md` records.** For each
feature, read its document's `## Dependencies` section and propose the edges
it implies, in machine-readable form:

> `config-export` depends on `settings-store`, `feature-flags`
> — from its Dependencies section: "needs the settings store to read from,
> and the flag registry to decide what is exportable".

- The user confirms, edits, adds and removes.
- **Never rewrite the prose.** It stays the human-facing statement; the edge
  list is its parsable projection, and drift between them is resolved by
  re-running this skill, not by editing feature documents.
- An edge the documents do not state is legitimate: the user may add it.
- Record only *feature-to-feature* edges. Task-level ordering already has
  `Preconditions:` in the backlog and is untouched by this skill.
- **An edge naming a slug that resolves to no feature** — a renamed or
  deleted feature, or a typo — is **reported and dropped**, never a refusal.
  Say which edge was dropped and why, and carry on, the same way
  `/architect`'s iterate guard ignores task IDs that resolve to nothing.

**4. Milestone status.** Use exactly these three values and nothing else:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `[PLANNED]` | Scheduled, not started. |
| `[ACTIVE]` | Being built now. **At most one milestone at a time.** |
| `[SHIPPED]` | Delivered. **Terminal — it can never reopen.** |

- A milestone new to the plan starts `[PLANNED]`.
- `[ACTIVE]` is the user's call — ask which milestone is being built now if
  it is not obvious and not already recorded. **More than one `[ACTIVE]`**
  (in the existing plan, or after the user's answer) → report both and ask
  which one is meant. Do not pick one.
- **`[SHIPPED]` is proposed, never applied automatically.** Propose it for a
  milestone only when *every* feature in it is `[DONE]` in `FEATURES.md`, or
  `[PLANNED]` **and** every task on its `Tasks:` line is `[DONE]` or
  `[SKIP]` in `TASKS.md` — a `[DONE]` feature already satisfies that same
  bar, just recorded on `FEATURES.md` instead of derived here. Then ask; the
  user confirms or declines.
- **`[SHIPPED]` never reopens.** Not on request, not with a flag. Follow-up
  work on a shipped milestone is a *new* milestone in the roadmap — the same
  discipline that makes `[DONE]` terminal for tasks and `[PLANNED]` → `[NEW]`
  illegal for features. If the user asks, say this and offer the new
  milestone instead.

**5. Reconciliation** (only when `PHASE 0` found an existing `PLAN.md`).
Follow `./reconciling.md` and fold its findings into this same proposal.
Everything — new placements, dropped slugs, re-read edges, added and orphaned
milestones — lands behind the one approval gate below.

---

PHASE 2 — VALIDATE

Run **before the approval gate and before any write**, on the proposal
PHASE 1 assembled. Both invariants (1 and 3) **refuse** rather than warn:
nothing is written, and there is no override flag for either. The only
refusals in this skill are PHASE 0's gate and these two invariants; an
explicit placement override, a milestone missing from the roadmap, a
milestone with no features, an edge slug that resolves to nothing, or a
missing roadmap are reports and warnings, never refusals.

**1. Cycles.** Walk the whole confirmed edge set, across milestones, and
detect cycles. On a cycle, report **the actual cycle path** and refuse:

> Refusing to write the plan: the dependencies contain a cycle.
>
>   `checkout` → `pricing` → `tax-rules` → `checkout`
>
> A cycle cannot be built in any order. Break it by removing one of those
> edges — usually the one the feature documents state least clearly — and
> re-run `/production-plan`.

Offer no flag to force past it and no "proceed anyway" option.

**2. Ordering within a milestone.** For each milestone, restrict the edge set
to the features in that milestone. The milestone's `Features:` list must be a
**topological order** of those edges: every feature appears after everything
it depends on. If it is not, report the offending pair and either fix the
order with the user or stop — never write a list you know violates its own
edges.

**3. A dependency in a later milestone → refuse outright.** If a feature in
milestone *i* depends on a feature in milestone *j* where *j* comes after *i*
in roadmap order, report both features **and both their milestones**, and
refuse:

> Refusing to write the plan: `m1-mvp`'s `config-export` depends on
> `sync-engine`, which is scheduled in `m3-teams`. A milestone cannot depend
> on a later one. Either move `sync-engine` earlier, move `config-export`
> later, or drop the edge.

A dependency **on a feature in `Unscheduled`** is *not* this refusal:
`Unscheduled` has no position, so it cannot be "later". Report it as a
warning — the dependency is unschedulable until that feature is placed — and
carry on.

**The approval gate.** Once validation passes, present the whole proposal in
one place and get the user's confirmation:

- Every milestone in order, with its status and its ordered `Features:` list.
- `Unscheduled`, with its features.
- Every explicit placement override, naming the `Source:` milestone and the
  milestone chosen instead.
- Every edge added, changed or removed this run, and every edge dropped for
  naming an unresolvable slug.
- Every status change proposed, `[SHIPPED]` proposals foremost.
- On a reconciliation, everything `./reconciling.md` turned up.

A `show` reply prints `PLAN.md` as it would be written and asks again.

**This is the run's one and only approval gate.** Do not gate anything
earlier and do not add a second gate before the write. Gate class:
`confirmation` when the run is a reconciliation and `./reconciling.md`
turned up nothing — under `unattended` it then passes on its own and the
closing report names the commit; `design` otherwise.

---

PHASE 3 — WRITE

- Write exactly one path: **`.claude/PLAN.md`**. Add it to `WRITTEN`. No
  other phase writes anything.
- On a re-run, update it in place: keep the milestone blocks, the orderings
  and the edges that did not change.
- Never write, under any circumstances, `.claude/FEATURES.md`,
  `.claude/TASKS.md`, task bodies, the feature documents or anything else
  under `.claude/domain/features/`, `product-roadmap.md`,
  `product-design.md`, `technical-direction.md`, or
  `.claude/domain/INDEX.md`. Report a problem this run notices in another
  artifact; never fix it here.

### The document schema

````markdown
# Plan

Roadmap: .claude/domain/product-roadmap.md
Last reconciled: <YYYY-MM-DD>

---

## <milestone-slug> — <milestone title>

Status: [PLANNED]
Covers: product-design.md § <Section>, product-design.md § <Section>

---

## Unscheduled

Features: <slug>, <slug>

## Dependencies

- <slug>: depends on <slug>, <slug>
- <slug>: depends on <slug>
````

Rules the schema is not free to bend:

- **`Roadmap:`** names the roadmap this plan was built against, or the
  literal `none` when the project has no roadmap.
- **`Last reconciled:`** is a plain date and is **informational only**.
  Nothing computes from it, nothing expires because of it, and no reader may
  treat it as a staleness signal — the real staleness signal is a
  `FEATURES.md` slug missing from the plan.
- **Milestones appear in roadmap order**, top to bottom, separated by `---`.
  The order comes from the roadmap's list positions, never from the slugs.
- **`Status:`** is exactly one of `[PLANNED]` / `[ACTIVE]` / `[SHIPPED]`, on
  every milestone block. Never on `Unscheduled`.
- **`Covers:`** is **derived** — rewritten from the roadmap's own `Covers:`
  lines on every run, section names only, with the roadmap's scope prose left
  where it belongs. It is never a source of truth: never hand-edit it and
  never let the user's edits to it survive a run. Omit the line entirely
  when there is no roadmap.
- **`Features:`** is a comma-separated, **ordered** list of feature slugs.
  The order is the priority. A milestone with no features carries
  `Features: none`.
- **`Unscheduled`** is a block with `Features:` and nothing else — no
  `Status:`, no `Covers:`. Write it even when empty (`Features: none`).
- **`## Dependencies` is one flat edge list at the end of the document**, one
  line per dependent feature, and there is **no `Depends:` line on a
  feature**: `PLAN.md` must not become a second index keyed by feature slug,
  and every edge stays in one place, where a cycle is visible to a human
  reader. A feature with no dependencies gets no line.
- **No dates, no estimates, no sizing, no percentages, no priority labels,
  and no readiness or coverage rollups.** Readiness, coverage and per-feature
  task counts are computed at read time by whatever reports the plan.
- **Never rename a feature slug or a milestone slug, or reuse one for
  something else.** Slugs are stable identifiers, like task IDs.

**Closing report.** State:

- Every milestone, in order, with its status and its ordered features.
- Everything in `Unscheduled`, and what would place it (a `Source:`
  parenthetical from `/architect`, or an explicit placement here).
- Every placement override applied.
- Every edge added, changed, removed or dropped.
- Every status change written, and every `[SHIPPED]` proposal the user
  declined.
- Every warning raised — an unscheduled dependency, a milestone slug absent
  from the roadmap, a milestone with no features.
- The paths written (`WRITTEN`).
- The next step: `/task-add feature=<slug>` for the first feature of the
  `[ACTIVE]` milestone.
- When `WRITTEN` is non-empty and `--no-commit` was passed: an explicit
  reminder that nothing was committed.

---

COMMIT AND PUSH (unless `--no-commit` was passed)

If COMMIT is false (`--no-commit` was passed), run no git/VCS command at
all. The plan is left uncommitted for the user to review.

If COMMIT is true (the default; the pull-at-start from PHASE 0 already
ran):

1. If `WRITTEN` is empty — validation refused, the user declined at the gate,
   or a re-run changed nothing — make no commit and no push. Say so and stop.
2. Stage EXACTLY the paths in `WRITTEN` — `.claude/PLAN.md` — and commit
   once:

   ```
   git add -- .claude/PLAN.md
   git commit -m "Update the production plan"
   ```

   Never use `git add -A`, `git add .`, or `git add -u`. On a non-git VCS,
   use the project's `## VCS` mapping in CLAUDE.md (git→`cm`).
3. On commit success, report the commit hash (`git rev-parse --short HEAD`).
   Then, unless NO_PUSH is true or the non-git VCS exemption applies,
   re-sync (`git pull` again — other commits may have landed while the run
   was in progress; a conflict aborts the merge, leaves the local commit
   intact and is reported, not pushed) and then `git push`.
4. On commit failure (e.g. a pre-commit hook rejects the commit): surface
   the exact output. Do NOT retry, amend, or use `--no-verify` /
   `--no-gpg-sign`. Files remain staged but uncommitted; tell the user.
5. On push failure (rejected, no upstream, no remote) or a pre-push
   conflict: surface the exact output. Never retry, never force-push. The
   commit exists locally; tell the user it needs a manual sync + push.

Never branch or tag.
