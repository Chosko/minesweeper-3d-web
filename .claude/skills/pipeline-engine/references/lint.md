# The drift catalogue

Authority for: every structural drift finding the pipeline reports — its
detection rule over `graph.md`'s edges, its severity, the one command that
fixes it and the line it prints as — and the two rules for a finding whose
index is absent or whose block cannot be read.

Authored here. `/pipeline-check` evaluates this catalogue, and any revision
surface that reports drift reads the same file, so a finding is defined once
and renders the same everywhere.

---

## What it detects

**Structural inconsistency only** — a reference between indexes that does not
resolve, or an index state its owner has not acted on. Whether a feature
document still describes what its tasks build is a judgement about meaning,
not structure: it is `/architect amend`'s precision guard, not this
catalogue's, and no finding here approximates it.

## What no rule reads

Every detection rule reads **index lines** — `.claude/FEATURES.md`,
`.claude/TASKS.md`, `.claude/PLAN.md`, `.claude/RUNBOOKS.md` — through the
`graph.md` edge it names. **No rule opens a file under `.claude/domain/`, and
only the two parking findings open one under `.claude/tasks/` or
`.claude/runbooks/`:** L12 opens the body of each `[PARKED]` task, for its
`## Parking handoff` heading; L13 opens the body of each runbook whose block
is not `[DONE]`, for its step markers. Each read is bounded by the index that
names the file, and neither reads a prompt block, a handoff's question or
anything else in the body. Parking leaves state an index cannot summarise —
a handoff lives in a body, `[P]` on a step heading — so a finding about it
must look there; no other finding does.

**L14 lists `.claude/specs/` and reads no spec.** A spec file has no index
line: its presence is the whole fact, so the finding lists the directory's
`*.md` files and opens none of them.

**No rule probes `.claude/tasks/archive/`, opens an archived file, or reports
on its contents.** The prohibition is stated once, here, and holds for the
whole catalogue and for any finding ever added to it: an archived task is
known to the lint only as an id absent from `TASKS.md`, which is all it needs
to be.

## Severity

Two levels, one discriminator:

- **`ERROR`** — a reference that cannot be resolved, or a state that will
  misdirect a run: something a pipeline command will act on wrongly if it is
  left.
- **`WARNING`** — a legal state that needs its owner's attention: nothing is
  broken, but someone has a step to take.

Every finding carries exactly one. The two are deliberately not
`/task-review`'s `BLOCKING` / `IMPORTANT` / `ADVISORY`, and deliberately clear
of every status vocabulary, so a grep for a status never returns a severity.

## The output line

Every finding prints as one line: the severity padded to seven characters,
then its message in plain words, then — in parentheses — the artifact, the
offending identifier and the index lines that prove it, then its fix:

```
<SEVERITY> <message> (<artifact> <identifier>[, <evidence>]) → <fix>
```

The message says what is wrong and why it matters, with no identifier in
it, per the plain-language rule of
`../../interaction-engine/references/messages.md` § *Questions*.
`<artifact>` is the index whose line the fix changes: `FEATURES.md`,
`PLAN.md`, `TASKS.md` or `RUNBOOKS.md` — or `.claude/specs/` for L14, whose
fix removes a file rather than changing a line. `<identifier>` is `task <N>`,
`feature <slug>`, `runbook <id>. <name>`, `spec <file>`, or `header` for a line outside any
block. Each finding below carries its own template; the fix is printed
verbatim.

---

## The catalogue

Fourteen findings, and no others. The catalogue is closed: adding a finding
is an edit to this file, so every consumer gains it at once and none can
disagree about whether it exists.

### L1 — a task's `Feature:` slug absent from `FEATURES.md` · ERROR

- **Walks.** E3b.
- **Needs.** `TASKS.md`, `FEATURES.md`.
- **Fires when** a summary block's `Feature: <slug>` names no entry in
  `FEATURES.md`.

```
ERROR   A task names a feature that does not exist (TASKS.md task <N>, Feature: <slug>) → /pipeline-revise
```

### L2 — a task with no `Feature:` line · WARNING

- **Walks.** E3b, absent.
- **Needs.** `TASKS.md`, `FEATURES.md`.
- **Fires when** `FEATURES.md` exists and a summary block carries no
  `Feature:` line. A free-form task is legal; on a project that keeps a
  feature index, it is work no feature accounts for.

```
WARNING A task belongs to no feature, on a project that keeps a feature index (TASKS.md task <N>, no Feature: line) → /pipeline-revise
```

### L3 — a `Preconditions:` id that resolves to no task · ERROR

- **Walks.** E4.
- **Needs.** `TASKS.md`.
- **Fires when** an id on a `Preconditions:` line is greater than `Last task
  number:` — an id never assigned. An id at or below the counter with no
  block is archived and terminal by E4's resolution, a satisfied
  precondition, and is not a finding.

```
ERROR   A task waits on a task that was never created (TASKS.md task <N>, Preconditions: <id>, Last task number: <K>) → /pipeline-revise
```

### L4 — a `Preconditions:` id naming a `[SKIP]` task · ERROR

- **Walks.** E4.
- **Needs.** `TASKS.md`.
- **Fires when** an id on a `Preconditions:` line resolves to a block whose
  `Status:` is `[SKIP]`. `[SKIP]` satisfies a precondition, so the dependent
  becomes eligible on work that was abandoned rather than done.

```
ERROR   A task waits on a task that was dropped, so it can never start (TASKS.md task <N>, Preconditions: <id> is [SKIP]) → /pipeline-revise
```

### L5 — a precondition cycle · ERROR

- **Walks.** E4, over live blocks only — an archived id is terminal and closes
  no loop.
- **Needs.** `TASKS.md`.
- **Fires when** following `Preconditions:` from a task leads back to it — a
  cycle in the sense
  `../../task-engine/references/resolution.md`
  § *Eligibility* gives it. Each cycle is reported once, on whichever of its
  tasks appears first in `TASKS.md`.

```
ERROR   Tasks wait on each other in a circle, so none of them can start (TASKS.md task <N>, cycle <N>, <M>, …, <N>) → /pipeline-revise
```

### L6 — an `[ITERATED]` feature · WARNING

- **Walks.** E3a — the feature's `Tasks:` are what re-planning reconciles.
- **Needs.** `FEATURES.md`.
- **Fires when** an entry's `Status:` is `[ITERATED]`: re-architected, and the
  backlog not yet re-planned against the new design.

```
WARNING A feature's design changed and its tasks were not re-planned (FEATURES.md feature <slug>, [ITERATED]) → /task-add feature=<slug>
```

### L7 — a `[STALE]` task · WARNING

- **Walks.** E3b, to name the feature in the message.
- **Needs.** `TASKS.md`.
- **Fires when** a summary block's `Status:` is `[STALE]`. What the tag means
  is `../../task-engine/references/stale.md`.
  With no `Feature:` line, the message says the originating feature is
  unrecorded.

```
WARNING A task was written before its feature's design changed, so it may ask for the old design (TASKS.md task <N>, [STALE], feature <slug>) → /pipeline-revise
```

### L8 — a `FEATURES.md` slug absent from `PLAN.md` · WARNING

- **Walks.** E5, from the feature's side.
- **Needs.** `FEATURES.md`, `PLAN.md`.
- **Fires when** an entry's slug is in no milestone's `Features:` and not in
  `## Unscheduled`'s. `Unscheduled` is a placement, not an absence; a
  `## Dependencies` line places nothing, so a slug named only there is still
  absent from the plan.

```
WARNING A feature is in no milestone of the plan (PLAN.md feature <slug>) → /production-plan
```

### L9 — a plan edge naming an unknown slug · ERROR

- **Walks.** E5.
- **Needs.** `FEATURES.md`, `PLAN.md`.
- **Fires when** a slug on any line E5 names — a milestone's or
  `Unscheduled`'s `Features:`, either side of a `## Dependencies` line — has
  no entry in `FEATURES.md`. One finding per unknown slug per line.

```
ERROR   The plan names a feature that does not exist (PLAN.md feature <slug>, named by <milestone-slug> Features: | Unscheduled | Dependencies (<dependent>)) → /pipeline-revise
```

Print exactly one of the three `named by` forms: the line that carries the
slug.

### L10 — a `[PENDING]` runbook whose every step is done · WARNING

- **Walks.** E6, from the index side.
- **Needs.** `RUNBOOKS.md`.
- **Fires when** an index block carries `Status: [PENDING]` together with
  `Steps: <n>/<n>` — done equal to total. **Derived from `RUNBOOKS.md` alone:**
  `Steps:` counts `[x]` steps only
  (`../../runbook-run/references/runbook-schema.md`
  § *The index block*), so `<n>/<n>` says every step is done while
  `[PENDING]` says the runbook is still waiting to run. The block contradicts
  itself, and neither half needs the body to see it.

```
WARNING A runbook has every step done but is still marked pending (RUNBOOKS.md runbook <id>. <name>, [PENDING], Steps: <n>/<n>) → /pipeline-revise
```

### L11 — a fully resolved `[PLANNED]` feature · WARNING

- **Walks.** E3a.
- **Needs.** `FEATURES.md`, `TASKS.md`.
- **Fires when** an entry's `Status:` is `[PLANNED]` and every id on its
  `Tasks:` line is `[DONE]`, `[SKIP]`, **or absent from `TASKS.md`**. An
  absent id is archived and terminal by E3a's resolution and counts as
  resolved; without that clause a cleaned feature would never be reported as
  ready to flip. `Tasks: none` satisfies it trivially.

```
WARNING Every task of a feature is finished, but the feature is still marked planned (FEATURES.md feature <slug>, [PLANNED]) → flip to [DONE]
```

### L12 — a `[PARKED]` task with no `## Parking handoff` · ERROR

- **Walks.** No edge: the body is the one `.claude/tasks/<N>.md` the block's
  id names (`../../task-engine/references/resolution.md`), opened for this
  finding alone — § *What no rule reads*.
- **Needs.** `TASKS.md`; the body of each `[PARKED]` task.
- **Fires when** a summary block's `Status:` is `[PARKED]` and its body has
  no `## Parking handoff` heading — or no body exists. What the handoff is,
  and that a parked body carries exactly one, is
  `../../task-engine/references/parking.md`
  § *The handoff*. `ERROR` because the unpark resumes the task from that
  section: without it the `Parked:` step and the `Question:` are gone, and
  the next run that reaches the task acts on a handoff that is not there. The
  fix is an attended `/task-implement <N>`, which unparks the task or reports
  what it cannot recover. Whether the `park/task-<N>` branch exists is not
  checked: git state differs across machines, and the unpark that needs the
  branch reports its absence itself.

```
ERROR   A parked task has lost the question it waits on (TASKS.md task <N>, [PARKED], no ## Parking handoff in its body) → /task-implement <N>
```

### L13 — a runbook's `[P]` steps and its `Parked:` line disagree · WARNING

- **Walks.** E6, followed into the body — the one finding that does,
  § *What no rule reads* — for its step markers only.
- **Needs.** `RUNBOOKS.md`; the body at `File:` of each block whose
  `Status:` is not `[DONE]` — a done runbook has no step left to be parked.
- **Fires when** the body marks a step `[P]` whose id the block's
  `Parked: steps <ids>` line does not list — the line absent included — or
  the line lists a step the body does not mark `[P]`. The line's rule is
  `../../runbook-run/references/runbook-schema.md`
  § *The index block*: present exactly while a step is `[P]`, holding
  exactly those ids. `WARNING` because the body is authoritative and the
  next run reads the body: nothing is misdirected, but `/runbook-list` and
  `/runbook-describe` show the index's version. One finding per runbook,
  naming both sides. The fix is `/runbook-run <id>`, which rewrites the
  index from the body at its next commit.

```
WARNING A runbook's list of parked steps disagrees with its body (RUNBOOKS.md runbook <id>. <name>, Parked: <ids | absent>, body [P] on <ids | none>) → /runbook-run <id>
```

### L14 — a spec file still under `.claude/specs/` · WARNING

- **Walks.** No edge: a directory listing of `.claude/specs/*.md` — the one
  finding that lists a directory, § *What no rule reads*.
- **Needs.** `.claude/specs/`; the probe's `specs` count says whether it
  holds any.
- **Fires when** a `*.md` file sits directly under `.claude/specs/`. One
  finding per file. `/quick-implement` commits a spec beside the change it
  describes, and only `/pipeline-revise --catch-up`, the run that brings the
  documentation up to date, deletes it — so a spec still present means the
  documentation still lags code that has landed. `WARNING` because nothing is
  misdirected: the code is right and the spec records what it decided; the
  documentation has a catch-up to take.

```
WARNING A change landed but the documentation has not caught up with it yet (.claude/specs/ spec <file>) → /pipeline-revise --catch-up .claude/specs/<file>
```

---

## Two deliberate absences

Both were considered and are not findings. They are recorded so a later
reader neither concludes they were forgotten nor adds them back.

**"A feature's `Tasks:` id absent from `TASKS.md`" is not a finding.**
`/task-clean` moves a pruned body to `.claude/tasks/archive/<N>.md` and leaves
the feature's `Tasks:` line intact, so that absence is the normal state of a
cleaned feature and means **archived, terminal** — the rule is
`../../task-engine/references/resolution.md`
§ *The archive*. Reporting it would flag every cleaned feature on the first
run against an archived backlog.

**"A pending runbook step naming a task already `[DONE]` or `[SKIP]`" is not a
finding.** Detecting it means reading a step's prompt block — which no rule
here does, L13's marker scan included, and which is why `graph.md` E7 has no
step-level index form. `/runbook-run` surfaces the same problem at
the moment it matters: it prints each step before spawning it. A
`RUNBOOKS.md` that carried per-step targets is what would make a cheap
index-only version possible; until it does, the finding stays out.

---

## Failure rules

**An absent index drops its findings.** A finding whose **Needs** names an
index — or, for L14, a directory — the project does not have is not
evaluated and not reported — dropped
from the run, never an error. A project with no `PLAN.md` has no plan
findings; that is not drift. An absent **body**, by contrast, is what L12 and
L13 exist to see: a `[PARKED]` task with no body is L12, and a non-`[DONE]`
block whose `File:` names no file is a malformed block, below.

**A malformed block is a finding of its own, never an abort.** A block missing
a line some finding reads, or carrying a value outside that line's vocabulary
— a `Status:` no status list contains, a `Steps:` that is not
`<done>/<total>`, a `Preconditions:` or `Tasks:` that is neither `none` nor a
list of ids — is reported, and the run carries on:

```
ERROR   An index line is missing or unreadable, so nothing that depends on it can be checked (<artifact> <identifier>, <the line>) → /pipeline-revise
```

It is `ERROR` because a block that cannot be read will misdirect any command
that acts on it. Its own findings are skipped for the run; as the far end of
another block's edge it still exists. It is not a twelfth catalogue entry: it
reports an index that cannot be read, not drift between indexes.
