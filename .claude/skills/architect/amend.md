# `/architect amend` — targeted changes to one or more feature documents

Read this when ARGUMENT PARSING recognised the `amend feature=<slug>[,<slug>...]
"<change>"` form, once PHASE 0's domain-layer gate has passed.

- This file carries the whole arm: a consumer that has read only this file —
  `/architect` itself, or a pipeline revision surface reading it by path —
  can execute it end to end without opening `SKILL.md`. Where a rule already
  lives in another file in this folder, this file cites it by path.
- Skip PHASE 1 (clarify) and PHASE 2 (architect) entirely: the change is
  described, not designed.
- Edit the sections the change names in each named document, run a
  **precision** iterate guard per feature in place of `./iterating.md`'s
  blanket one, settle one question per feature at one gate — on your own
  when the evidence is clear, asking only when it is not — and write.
- Write no progress marker: an amendment is one gate long and has nothing
  to resume.
- Run steps 1–3 per feature, in the order the slugs were given; step 4 is one
  gate for all of them; steps 5 and 6 write and report per feature.

## Inputs

- `<slugs>` — from `feature=<slug>[,<slug>...]`: one or more features to
  amend, each an existing `.claude/FEATURES.md` slug, comma-separated with no
  spaces.
- `<change>` — the quoted text after it: what to change, naming the
  section(s) of each feature document it lands in. One change, applied to
  every named feature; a change that reads differently per feature names the
  feature beside the part that is its own.
- `--commit`, `--no-commit`, `--no-push` — unchanged in meaning; see
  *Committing* below.

Read these, and nothing beyond them:

1. `.claude/FEATURES.md` — the entry for each slug: its `Status:`, `Doc:`,
   `Source:` and `Tasks:` lines.
2. Each `Doc:` document.
3. `.claude/TASKS.md` — the summary block of each id on each `Tasks:` line.
4. `.claude/tasks/<N>.md` — only for a task the guard cannot classify from
   its summary block (step 3), and only that task's body.
5. `.claude/domain/product-design.md` — only when the change belongs
   upstream (step 2).

Not the roadmap, not `technical-direction.md`, not the context layer, not
source: nothing is being designed.

## 1. Resolve the features

- `.claude/FEATURES.md` is absent, or has no entry for a slug → stop the
  whole run, listing the slugs that do exist (or saying there are none), and
  write nothing. Never guess at a near match, and never proceed with the
  slugs that did resolve: a slug the user typed wrong is a change they have
  not yet described.
- A `Doc:` names a file that does not exist → stop the whole run and say so,
  writing nothing. Repairing the disagreement between entry and document is
  a full `/architect <slug>` run's job, not an amendment's.

## 2. Scope the change, per feature

Pin the change to the `##` sections of the document it edits — the sections
`./feature-doc-template.md` defines, as this document actually carries them.
A section counts as named when the change names it, or quotes or names a
passage that lives in it.

- **Refuse, for that document, a change that names no section and points at
  no passage you can locate in it**, with a pointer to the full skill:

  > This change can't be scoped to named sections of `<Doc: path>`. Name the
  > sections it touches, or re-architect the feature with `/architect <slug>`.

  On a single-feature run that ends the run. On a multi-feature run, drop
  the feature with that line and proceed with the rest.
- Draft the edit to the pinned sections only, in the document's own register
  and at its mid-to-high level. `./feature-doc-template.md`'s two
  prohibitions and its update-in-place rule apply unchanged. Leave every
  section not pinned exactly as it is.
- **Upstream.** When the change moves a high-level decision that
  `product-design.md` records — an entry's `Source:` names a
  `product-design.md` section, and that section says otherwise — draft the
  matching high-level edit there too, **once for the run**: several features
  sharing one source section share one upstream edit. Keep the technical
  detail in the feature documents.

## 3. The precision guard, per feature

**A `[NEW]` feature takes no guard at all** — it has no tasks. Its touched
set is empty.

Otherwise:

1. Collect the tasks exactly as `./iterating.md` § 1 does: the ids on
   `Tasks:`, each looked up in `.claude/TASKS.md`, an id that resolves to
   nothing ignored, never an error.
2. Never classify or touch a `[DONE]` or `[SKIP]` task.
3. **Classify every other resolved task as touched or untouched** by the
   change:
   - **From its summary block alone** — its title and its `Files:` line, set
     against the sections step 2 pinned. A task is *touched* when what its
     title says it delivers, or what its `Files:` build, is governed by a
     changed section; *untouched* when neither is.
   - **Open its body only when the summary block cannot decide** —
     `.claude/tasks/<N>.md`, for that task alone. Record a body that decides
     as *touched on body* or *untouched on body*. A task whose body still
     cannot decide is classified *touched* and recorded as *undecided*:
     staling a task that survives costs one reconciliation, while leaving
     one that does not survive costs a wrong implementation.
   - Classify a task already `[STALE]` like any other; staling it again is a
     no-op.

Then, before the gate:

- **A touched `[IN PROGRESS]` task drops the feature from the run.** One
  line, and nothing of that feature is written:

  > Can't amend `<slug>`: task <N> — "<title>" is `[IN PROGRESS]`, and this
  > change touches it. An implementation is underway against the current
  > design. Finish that task, or reset its status, then re-run.

  On a single-feature run that ends the run with nothing written. On a
  multi-feature run the other features proceed. This is `./iterating.md`
  § 2's refusal narrowed to the touched set, and its **no override** holds
  unchanged — not on the user's insistence, not with a flag.
- **An untouched `[IN PROGRESS]` task does not refuse.** List it at the gate
  as untouched and leave it alone.

When every feature was dropped, in step 2 or here, stop before the gate with
nothing written.

## 4. The gate

The arm's one and only gate, gate class `confirmation`
(`../interaction-engine/references/gates.md`), written to
`../interaction-engine/references/messages.md`. One message, one section per
feature that reached it, each carrying:

1. **The change** — what each edited section will say differently, and why,
   in plain words, the section named last. A `show` reply prints the drafted
   edits and asks again.
2. **The touched set** — each touched task's id, status and title, and what
   decided it: *summary block*, *body*, or *undecided*. Untouched live tasks
   follow, one line each, so a classification can be overruled.
3. **The proposed outcome**: which tasks go `[STALE]`, and what the
   feature's `Status:` becomes — under the classification applied on a clear
   case, under each answer when the question is asked.
4. **The classification** — a `Classified:` line on a clear case, the
   question on an ambiguous one, by the rule below.

Render the `product-design.md` edit, when step 2 drafted one, once, above the
feature sections. Name a feature dropped in step 2 or 3 in one line above
them too, so the gate shows the whole run.

### Clear or ambiguous, per feature

Settle whether the change is editorial for a feature by a closed rule over
findings items 1–3 already render — the touched set and what decided each
status in it, the drafted edit, and the scope call (§ *The status
outcome*). "Clear" means a mechanical signal, never your confidence that the
answer looks obvious. Test in this order; the first that matches wins:

1. **Ambiguous** — any one of:
   - a live task is *undecided* — its body was read and still could not
     decide;
   - the scope call is borderline — the change may add scope, but no
     component, contract or promise it adds can be named;
   - the findings point different ways — no task is touched and no scope is
     added, yet contract or interface text in an edited section changes.
2. **Clear not editorial** — a task is touched on its summary block or on its
   body, or the added scope is a nameable component, contract or promise.
3. **Clear editorial** — the touched set is empty, no scope is added, and no
   contract or interface text in the edited sections changes.

A `[NEW]` feature has no tasks, so its touched set is empty; the scope call
and the edited text classify it like any other.

### A clear case

Ask no question. After items 1–3, write one line:

```
Classified: <editorial | not editorial> — <plain reason> (<evidence>)
```

- The plain reason says in words what decided it — *wording only, nothing
  any task builds changes*, or *tasks already planned build what this
  changes* / *it adds <the scope, in words>*.
- The evidence in the parentheses cites only what items 1–3 render, never an
  adjective: `touched on summary block: <ids>`, `touched on body: <ids>`
  and/or `scope added: <named scope item> (§ <edited section>)` for not
  editorial; `no task touched, no scope added, no contract text changed` for
  editorial.

### An ambiguous case

Ask the question, with one marked letter — the recommendation:

> <evidence line>
>
> A. **Wording only** — edit the document; no task needs redoing and the
>    feature's status stays `<status>`.
> B. **More than wording** — edit the document, mark the tasks it touches
>    for re-planning (<ids | none>), and the status becomes `<outcome>`.
> C. **Stop** — write nothing for this feature.
>
> Is this change to <feature title> only wording, with nothing any task
> builds changing — A, B or C? (`<slug>`)

**Derive the recommendation, never judge it.** It is a closed rule over two
findings the gate already renders — the touched set (item 2) and the scope
call (item 3, § *The status outcome*) — with no inference of its own:

- touched set empty **and** no scope added → mark **A**;
- otherwise → mark **B**.

The evidence line above the letters states which findings decided it, citing
only what items 2–3 already render — a task id, an edited section, or the
named scope item — never an adjective:

- A marked: `Recommended: A — no task builds anything this touches and it
  adds no scope, so A and B write the identical set here.` A is marked only
  on that pair of findings, and on it A and B do write the identical set — no
  task to stale, no `Status:` change. Still offer both letters, so the
  classification can be overruled.
- B marked: `Recommended: B — <tasks already planned build what this
  changes | it adds <the scope, in words>> (touched: <ids>; scope added:
  <named scope item> (§ <edited section>))`.

The marked letter is a recommendation, not an answer: the reply still has to
name a letter, and nothing is written on it alone.

### Waiting, on a multi-feature run

- Wait for a reply only when at least one feature is ambiguous. Clear
  features never wait: with no feature asked, render the `Classified:` lines
  and go straight to step 5.
- One reply answers every asked feature: a letter per feature (`a: A, c: B`),
  or one letter for all of them (`B`). An asked feature the reply leaves
  unnamed is C — the marked letter is never written on alone.
- Under `unattended` an ambiguous feature's question is a real decision
  (`gates.md` § *Real decisions*): write and commit the clear features, then
  stop the run with every asked feature's question, its features written
  nothing.

### A classification carried from `/pipeline-revise`

Only `/pipeline-revise` carries a classification; standalone `/architect
amend` applies the clear-or-ambiguous rule above. When this arm runs as an
owner step of `/pipeline-revise`, that skill's gate has already settled the
editorial question for the same change — by the user's reply, or by its own
classification when nothing there was open. Set that carried classification,
per feature, against the letter this arm's own findings mark under the
recommendation rule above:

- **They agree** — apply it with no prompt. After items 1–3, one line —
  `Classified: <editorial | not editorial> — carried from the revise gate; this edit's own findings agree: <evidence>`.
- **They disagree** — **the stricter classification applies**: *not
  editorial* over *editorial*, whichever side carried it. No prompt. After
  items 1–3, one line —
  `Classified: not editorial — carried: <carried>; applied: not editorial — <evidence>`
  — and the closing line in step 6 states the deviation.

The carried classification replaces the clear-or-ambiguous rule: resolve an
ambiguous case under it by the same comparison, the arm's own marked letter
standing for its findings. Never ask the question on a case a carried
classification settles.

### Replies

- Whenever the arm asks, the user may overrule a touched/untouched call, or
  the scope call below, in the same answer, for any feature. Re-render the
  outcome and re-apply the rules above to the new findings: write without
  another prompt when every feature is now clear, and ask again otherwise.
- A reclassification that makes an `[IN PROGRESS]` task touched drops that
  feature exactly as step 3 does.
- Wait for an explicit answer. Silence, an unclear reply or EOF is C for
  every asked feature. No flag pre-answers the question.

### The status outcome

Choose among the transitions `./feature-doc-template.md`
§ *Status transitions this skill may write* already allows. Add none; that
section's illegal list binds here too.

- **Editorial (A)** — stale no task, and leave `Status:` as it was.
- **Not editorial (B)** — write `[STALE]` on the touched tasks, and on those
  only. Move the feature to `[ITERATED]` — from `[PLANNED]` or `[DONE]`; an
  `[ITERATED]` feature stays `[ITERATED]` — when any task was staled, **or**
  when the change adds scope no existing task covers: a component, a
  contract or a promise that no live task's title or `Files:` answers to.
  Make that scope call yourself and show it at the gate as part of the
  proposed outcome; it is not a second question. Otherwise leave `Status:`
  as it was.
- A `[NEW]` feature stays `[NEW]` under either answer.

A non-editorial change to a `[DONE]` feature therefore reaches `[ITERATED]`
whenever it adds scope: its completed tasks are never touched, and the new
work is new tasks.

## 5. Write

For every feature classified A or B — answered, applied by a clear case, or
applied from a carried classification — write exactly the following, adding
each path written to `WRITTEN`:

| Path | What is written |
| --- | --- |
| Each `Doc:` document | The sections step 2 pinned, as approved at the gate. |
| `.claude/domain/product-design.md` | The upstream edit — only when step 2 drafted one; once. |
| `.claude/TASKS.md` | `Status: [STALE]` on each touched task — B only. `Status:` lines only, as `./iterating.md` § 4.1 writes them. |
| `.claude/FEATURES.md` | Each entry's `Status:` line — only when the outcome changes it. |

That set is closed. Never `Doc:`, `Source:` or `Tasks:`; never
`.claude/domain/INDEX.md`, which already registers the document; never a
task body, not even one step 3 opened; never a progress marker. A feature
answered C, or dropped, gets no write.

## 6. Report

One closing line per feature:

```
Amended <feature title> — <what changed, in plain words>; <wording only | tasks to re-plan: <titles> | no task to re-plan>[; treated as more than wording, stricter than the revise gate's <carried> call] — status <old> → <new> (`<slug>`: <section>, <section>[; product-design.md § <section>]; stale: <ids | none>).
```

- A dropped feature reports the line step 2 or 3 gave it.
- When any task was staled, follow the lines with
  `Reconcile with /task-add feature=<slug>.` for each such feature — a stale
  task the user is not told about is the failure the guard exists to
  prevent.
- When `WRITTEN` is non-empty and the run committed nothing, end with an
  explicit reminder that nothing was committed.

## Committing

- Under `/architect amend`, `SKILL.md`'s COMMIT AND PUSH applies to
  `WRITTEN` unchanged, one commit for the whole run: `--commit`,
  `--no-commit` and `--no-push` mean what they mean on every other run, and
  PHASE 0 ran the pull-at-start before dispatching here.
- A consumer that executes this file by path commits under its own rules;
  the write set in step 5 is what it stages.
