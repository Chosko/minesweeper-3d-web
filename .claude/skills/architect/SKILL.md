# /architect
# Global skill: design the implementation architecture of one or more
# features and write it down as low-level feature documentation under
# `.claude/domain/features/`, indexed in `.claude/FEATURES.md`. Stage 3 of
# the product pipeline: consumes a high-level feature (or a bare prompt) and
# produces the document `/task-add feature=<slug>` turns into tasks. Grounds
# the architecture in `technical-direction.md` or the existing code, or
# proposes a stack when there is neither. On a roadmapped project switches
# per target into slice mode — one milestone's scope slice, its exclusions
# as non-goals, the milestone recorded on the `FEATURES.md` `Source:` line —
# unless `--no-slices` is passed. Re-architecting a feature that already has
# an entry runs an iterate guard: refuses outright while any of its tasks is
# [IN PROGRESS], otherwise asks, then flips surviving tasks [STALE] and the
# feature [ITERATED], with no ask when no task is left to invalidate. The
# amend form changes the named sections of one or more documents behind one
# gate: per feature, a precision guard marks [STALE] only the tasks the
# change touches, drops the feature when a touched task is [IN PROGRESS],
# settles the editorial call on mechanical evidence in one Classified: line,
# and asks only when the call rests on judgement. Requires `/domain-setup`.
# At a genuine design fork
# offers to convene claude-council when that skill is installed, and is
# silent when it is not. Commits and pushes exactly the paths the run wrote
# by default.
# Usage: /architect                        (read product-design.md, ask which feature)
#        /architect <feature name> [...]   (architect the named feature(s))
#        /architect <free-form description of what to build>
#        /architect <feature name> <milestone-slug>  (pick the slice up front on a roadmapped project)
#        /architect <args> --no-slices     (ignore the roadmap; resolve every target traditionally)
#        /architect amend feature=<slug>[,<slug>...] "<change>"  (targeted change to one or more feature documents)
#        /architect <args> --no-commit     (write everything, run no git command)
#        /architect <args> --no-push       (commit what this run wrote, skip the push)
#        /architect <args> --attended | --unattended

GOAL
- Decide how a feature will be built, grounded in the code that already
  exists — or, on a greenfield project, in a tech stack chosen with the user.
- Write the result as technical documentation of **low-level features**: one
  document per separately designable unit. One high-level feature may
  produce several low-level ones; that is normal ("accounts" routinely
  becomes authentication, session handling and profile management).
- Stay **mid-to-high technical**: components and their responsibilities,
  data and state, interfaces and contracts, dependencies. No real code and
  no file-by-file plans — those are `/task-add`'s output, produced at
  planning time against the codebase as it then stands.
- Design and document only; never edit source code.
- Read [`.claude/domain/product-workflow.md`](../../.claude/domain/product-workflow.md)
  in the target project if it has one; this skill is its main implementation.

$ARGUMENTS

SUPPORTING FILES (read on demand — not up front)

| Read this file | Exactly when |
| -------------- | ------------ |
| `../interaction-engine/references/policy.md` | Every run, at ARGUMENT PARSING, to resolve the interaction policy. |
| `../interaction-engine/references/messages.md` | Every run, before the first question, gate or closing report — every one of them follows it. |
| `../interaction-engine/references/gates.md` | The policy resolved to `unattended`. |
| `./sectioned-input.md` | PHASE 0, for each target resolving in **traditional mode** — no roadmap, or `--no-slices`, or a roadmap that does not slice this target's section. Matching against `product-design.md`'s sections and existing `FEATURES.md` slugs, and the `Source:` value that produces. |
| `./sliced-input.md` | PHASE 0, for each target resolving in **slice mode** — `.claude/domain/product-roadmap.md` carries at least one milestone with a `Covers:` line, a slice matches this target, and `--no-slices` was not passed. Slice resolution, disambiguation, exclusions into non-goals, and the extended `Source:`. |
| `./iterating.md` | PHASE 0 finds the target feature already has a `FEATURES.md` entry. Read before PHASE 0b. |
| `./amend.md` | ARGUMENT PARSING recognised `amend feature=<slug>[,<slug>...] "<change>"`. Read once PHASE 0's gate has passed; it carries the whole amend path, including its per-feature precision guard, and replaces input resolution, PHASE 0b and PHASES 1–3 for the run. |
| `./tech-stack-selection.md` | The project has NO existing tech stack AND no `technical-direction.md` (greenfield). Read at the start of PHASE 2. |
| `./feature-doc-template.md` | PHASE 3, always — the feature-document schema and the `FEATURES.md` entry format. |
| `./council-gate.md` | PHASE 2 reaches a genuine design fork — a real trade-off with nameable stakes, expensive to reverse once tasks exist. Not on a fork settled by an existing stack, and not when the blocker is a missing fact (that is a PHASE 1 clarification). |

- Never read a supporting file speculatively.
- Read an input-resolution file per target, only once the PHASE 0 dispatch
  has decided which mode that target takes, and never both for the same
  target.
- The common path — a brownfield project with no roadmap, a feature
  architected for the first time — reads only `./sectioned-input.md` and
  `./feature-doc-template.md`.
- An `amend` run reads `./amend.md`, then `./iterating.md` and
  `./feature-doc-template.md` only where `./amend.md` cites them, and never
  an input-resolution file.

---

ARGUMENT PARSING

Scan `$ARGUMENTS` and strip each flag found:

- `--no-commit` → COMMIT = false; otherwise COMMIT = true (this skill commits
  and pushes what it wrote by default). `--no-commit` implies NO_PUSH:
  nothing is committed, so nothing is there to push.
- `--commit` → accepted and stripped; a silent no-op naming the default. If
  both `--commit` and `--no-commit` appear, stop with:
  `--commit and --no-commit cannot be combined. Pick one.`
- `--no-push` → NO_PUSH = true. It only matters when COMMIT is true: skip the
  pull at start, the pre-push re-sync and the push, still committing as
  always.
- `--attended` / `--unattended` → resolve the run's interaction policy from
  them, a policy handed down by a parent run and the project's `CLAUDE.md`,
  per `../interaction-engine/references/policy.md`, which holds their
  argument errors. Each gate below carries its class tag
  (`../interaction-engine/references/gates.md`). This skill cannot park: a
  run that stops on what waits leaves only the PHASE 2 progress marker
  written.
- `--no-slices` → NO_SLICES = true: PHASE 0 skips the roadmap probe entirely
  and every target resolves in traditional mode. On a project with no
  roadmap it is a silent no-op — never warn about it.

Then detect the amend form:

- Set AMEND = true only when what remains opens with the literal token
  `amend` immediately followed by a `feature=` token. The token's value is
  one or more slugs, comma-separated with no spaces; the rest is the change,
  as one quoted string — `amend feature=<slug>[,<slug>...] "<change>"`.
- Input that opens with `amend` but not with `amend feature=` is not the
  amend form: it falls through to ordinary input resolution as a free-form
  description.
- An empty slug list, an empty slug inside it, or a missing change stops the
  run with:
  `amend needs feature=<slug>[,<slug>...] and the change to make, e.g. /architect amend feature=password-auth "Data and state: sessions expire after 30 days".`
- `--no-commit` and `--no-push` compose with it unchanged. `--no-slices` is
  accepted and has nothing to act on, since the amend path resolves no input.

Otherwise what remains is the input, resolved in PHASE 0. Its forms — empty,
one or more feature names, or a free-form description — and the rules that
match them are carried by the input-resolution file PHASE 0 dispatches to.

Maintain a `WRITTEN` list of every path this invocation wrote. It drives the
final report and the optional commit.

---

PHASE 0 — GATE + INPUT

**Gate.** Probe `.claude/domain/` (Glob) and `.claude/domain/INDEX.md`
(Read). If either is missing, stop:

> The domain knowledge layer hasn't been initialized in this project. Run
> `/domain-setup` first — it creates `.claude/domain/`, the domain
> `INDEX.md`, and `.claude/FEATURES.md`. Then re-run `/architect`.

Do not proceed and do not create the layer yourself. No exceptions.

**Pull at start.** If COMMIT is true and the project's CLAUDE.md does not
carry a `## VCS` override (non-git), run `git pull` on the current branch,
per the commit-and-push protocol. A conflict stops the run here — report the
conflict output and tell the user to resolve manually and re-run.

**Amend dispatch.** If AMEND is true, read `./amend.md` now and follow it for
the rest of the run. It replaces everything below in PHASE 0, PHASE 0b,
PHASE 1, PHASE 2 and PHASE 3 — the clarify and architecture phases do not run
on this path — and the run then ends with COMMIT AND PUSH exactly as any
other run does.

**Read the inputs**, in this order, stopping when you have what you need:

1. `.claude/domain/INDEX.md` — what domain knowledge exists.
2. `.claude/domain/product-design.md`, if present — the high-level features
   and the decisions above them. Absent is fine: architect from the prompt.
3. `.claude/domain/technical-direction.md`, if present — the product's
   recorded technical foundations: stack, topology, data, hosting,
   protocols. Absent is fine: fall back to reading the stack off the code,
   or to `./tech-stack-selection.md` on a genuinely greenfield project.
4. `.claude/FEATURES.md` — existing features, their statuses, their `Tasks:`
   lines.
5. `.claude/context/INDEX.md` and the context files relevant to the area
   under design, if a context layer exists. Prefer this to reading source:
   it is the cheapest route to the existing architecture.
6. Source files, only where the context layer is thin or absent and the
   design genuinely depends on how something currently works.

**Probe for a roadmap.** Unless NO_SLICES is true:

- Glob for `.claude/domain/product-roadmap.md`. If it exists, read it and
  note every milestone carrying a `Covers:` line and the slices under it.
- That document with at least one `Covers:` line is the whole of slice
  mode's activation — there is no flag file, no settings key and no
  frontmatter switch.
- If the document is absent or carries no `Covers:` line (or NO_SLICES is
  true), there are no slices and the probe says nothing: a project with no
  roadmap is the normal case, not a warning.

**Resolve the target feature(s) — dispatching per target, not per run.** One
invocation may architect several targets, and a roadmap that slices
`§ Authentication` may say nothing about `§ Config export`. For each target
independently:

- A slice matches this target → read `./sliced-input.md` and follow it for
  this target.
- No slice matches → read `./sectioned-input.md` and follow it for this
  target. When the probe did find a roadmap, say in one line that this
  target's section is unsliced and is taking the traditional path.

Read each of the two files at most once per run, and never read a mode's
file for a target that did not dispatch to it.

**Detect whether a stack exists.**

- A present `technical-direction.md` counts as a stack that exists, exactly
  like an established codebase stack — note this and move on.
- Otherwise note, from what you read, whether this project already has a
  technology stack (language, framework, storage, delivery).
- PHASE 2 reads `./tech-stack-selection.md` only when no stack exists in
  either form.

**Check for existing entries.** For each target feature, look for a
`FEATURES.md` entry. If any target already has one, read `./iterating.md`
and continue to PHASE 0b. If none do, skip PHASE 0b entirely.

**Check for an interrupted session.** For each target:

1. Derive a `<target-slug>` — the kebab-case of the resolved feature name,
   or, for a free-form prompt with no named feature, a short kebab-case
   label drawn from the prompt's first few words.
2. Glob for `.claude/domain/features/<target-slug>.architect-progress.md`.
   If it exists:
   - Read it and summarize, in a few lines, what the last session covered
     and where it stopped — the same report-don't-guess spirit as
     `skills/product-design/resuming.md`, at this skill's smaller scale.
   - Ask whether to resume (continue PHASE 2 treating the summarized ground
     as already covered) or start fresh (delete the marker, begin PHASE 2
     from the top for this target). Wait for an explicit answer; do not
     guess. Gate class: `design`.

Run this check independently of the `FEATURES.md`-entry check: the marker
tracks this skill's own conversational progress, not the feature's write
state, so a target can have both.

---

PHASE 0b — ITERATE GUARD (only when a target feature already has an entry)

Follow `./iterating.md`, which carries the full protocol. In summary, per
existing target feature:

1. Read the entry's `Tasks:` IDs; look each up in `.claude/TASKS.md`.
2. **Any `[IN PROGRESS]` task → REFUSE.** Report the task ID and title and
   stop the run. There is no override — not on the user's insistence, not
   with a flag: an implementation is underway against the current design,
   and changing it underneath corrupts both the task and the feature. Tell
   the user to finish or reset that task first. The same holds for the drop
   a touched `[IN PROGRESS]` task causes in `./amend.md`.
3. **Any other non-`[DONE]` task → ask.** List them with statuses and
   titles, state that re-architecting may invalidate them, and offer stop or
   proceed. Gate class: `design`.
4. **On proceed** — flip every non-`[DONE]` task to `[STALE]` in
   `.claude/TASKS.md` and set the feature's status to `[ITERATED]` (from
   `[PLANNED]` or `[DONE]`).
5. **No resolvable tasks** (`Tasks: none`, or every listed ID resolving to
   nothing — the same case) → skip steps 2–4's task half: no list, no ask, no
   `TASKS.md` write. Decide the status by the entry's own `Status:`, never by
   the `Tasks:` line: `[NEW]` stays `[NEW]`, `[ITERATED]` stays
   `[ITERATED]`, and `[PLANNED]` or `[DONE]` flips to `[ITERATED]` and is
   named in PHASE 3's report.
6. **IDs that resolve to no task** are ignored, not an error. An ID absent
   from `.claude/TASKS.md` is archived and terminal (`task-engine`'s
   `references/resolution.md` § *The archive*), so it has nothing to
   refuse on, ask about or mark `[STALE]`. A hand-edited backlog must not
   break the run either.

`[DONE]` tasks are never touched, whatever the design does afterwards.

Write to `.claude/TASKS.md` only here and under `./amend.md`'s precision
guard, and in both cases write nothing but `Status:` lines flipped to
`[STALE]`. Never create tasks, and never create, delete or reorder task
entries.

---

PHASE 1 — CLARIFY (skipped when everything is clear)

- Ask only what you cannot resolve from the design documents and the
  codebase. Cap it at a handful of focused questions, each with the answer
  you'd pick and why, so the user can confirm in a word.
- Under `unattended` these are real decisions
  (`../interaction-engine/references/gates.md` § *Real decisions*): the run
  stops with all of them asked together.
- If there are no open questions, say so in one line — "The feature is
  unambiguous as described; no questions." — and go straight to PHASE 2. Do
  not manufacture questions to fill the phase.
- When the feature came from `product-design.md` and an answer changes what
  that document says, write the answer back into `product-design.md` in
  PHASE 3, so the next reader does not ask the same question.

---

PHASE 2 — ARCHITECT (conversational)

**2a. Tech stack — only when the project has no existing stack.** Read
`./tech-stack-selection.md` and follow it: propose candidate stacks with
their trade-offs, tie each back to the product design, recommend one, and
let the user choose. Skip this step entirely whenever a stack already
exists — a recorded `technical-direction.md`, or an established codebase
stack — and adopt what is there. Say in one line that you are doing so.

**2b. Architecture.** Work top-down, conversationally.

- When `technical-direction.md` exists, design within it and say so in one
  line, naming the document ("Designing within the recorded technical
  direction — see technical-direction.md"). Treat it exactly as an existing
  codebase stack: adopted, not re-argued.
- If the feature genuinely doesn't fit what it records, flag the mismatch
  once as a concern, then design around it anyway. Never silently override
  the direction, and never write or edit `technical-direction.md` — it is
  `/product-design`'s document; the remedy is telling the user to re-run
  `/product-design`.

Then:

1. Propose the shape — the components this feature needs, what each is
   responsible for, and how they talk. Where there is a real choice, present
   two or three options with their trade-offs and a recommendation, rather
   than presenting one design as inevitable. When that choice is a genuine
   fork — defensible options, nameable stakes, expensive to reverse once
   tasks exist — read `./council-gate.md` and follow it before you
   recommend.
2. Descend into the parts that carry risk: data and state, the interfaces
   between components, what happens at the boundaries with existing code.
3. Ask about the decisions you cannot make from the code — anything where
   the right answer depends on intent rather than structure.
4. Identify the seams: where does this feature end and the next begin? A
   high-level feature that will not fit in one document is where the
   low-level split comes from. Propose the split and let the user confirm
   it — gate class `design`. Where the split could defensibly fall in more
   than one place and the choice would shape every task generated from it,
   `./council-gate.md` applies here too.
5. Name the dependencies on other features, and the open questions you could
   not close. Put open questions into the document rather than resolving
   them by guesswork.

**Stop at mid-to-high level.** Component names and responsibilities yes;
class-by-class breakdowns no. Interface contracts in prose or signatures
yes; implementations no. "State is persisted per user" yes; a migration
script no. If you find yourself writing code or listing file paths to edit,
you have gone one level too far — that is `/task-add`'s work, and doing it
here freezes decisions that should be made against the codebase at planning
time.

**Progress marker.** At each checkpoint above where real ground has been
covered (stack chosen, shape proposed, data/interfaces/seams discussed,
dependencies and open questions named) and whenever the conversation might
end, write or rewrite
`.claude/domain/features/<target-slug>.architect-progress.md` with a short
recap:

- which of the steps above are covered;
- the decisions made so far, as a few bullets;
- any open questions raised so far;
- any council verdict already obtained (see `./council-gate.md` step 8 —
  recording it stops a resumed session from paying for the same run twice).

Keep it short — a resume aid, not a second copy of the feature document —
and keep out all of `FEATURES.md`'s and `TASKS.md`'s status vocabulary (no
`[NEW]`/`[PLANNED]`/`[IN PROGRESS]`/etc.), so it can never be confused with
either.

**Confirm.** The user confirms the architecture before PHASE 3 writes the
feature document(s). Gate class: `design`. A council verdict is an input to
that confirmation, never a substitute for it, however confident it came
back.

---

PHASE 3 — WRITE

Read `./feature-doc-template.md` for both schemas below.

1. **One document per low-level feature**, at
   `.claude/domain/features/<slug>.md`. Slugs are kebab-case and **stable**:
   a re-architected feature keeps its slug forever, exactly like a task ID —
   never rename a slug or reuse one for a different feature.
   Re-architecting updates the document in place.

2. **One `FEATURES.md` entry per feature**, appended for a new feature or
   updated in place for an existing one. Write exactly four fields:

   - `Status:` — `[NEW]` for a first write; `[ITERATED]` when PHASE 0b
     transitioned it; unchanged otherwise.
   - `Doc:` — the document path.
   - `Source:` — `product-design.md § <section>`, or the literal `prompt`
     when architected directly with no design documents.
   - `Tasks:` — written as `none` **only** when creating a brand-new entry.
     On an existing entry, leave the `Tasks:` line exactly as it is. It
     belongs to `/task-add`; overwriting it destroys the link that makes
     reconciliation possible.

   Never write `[PLANNED]` (`/task-add`'s transition) or `[DONE]`
   (`/task-implement`'s field, proposed and user-confirmed, or a human's by
   hand — this skill only reads it, to decide whether the iterate guard
   applies). Never move a `[PLANNED]` or `[DONE]` feature back to `[NEW]`:
   tasks were generated from that feature, which cannot be un-happened.

3. **Register new documents in `.claude/domain/INDEX.md`** — one
   `| File | Covers |` row each. Leave existing rows alone.

4. **Update `product-design.md`** where the architecture changed a
   high-level decision, or where PHASE 1 produced a clarification that
   belongs upstream. Keep it high-level: the technical detail stays in the
   feature document.

5. **Clear the progress marker.** For each target just written, delete its
   `.claude/domain/features/<target-slug>.architect-progress.md` if it
   exists — a feature that finished writing must never still look
   interrupted. If COMMIT is true and the marker had previously been
   committed (an earlier, separately-committed interrupted run), add its
   path to `WRITTEN` so the deletion is staged and committed like any other
   change; if it only ever existed uncommitted within this same run,
   deleting the file is enough.

**Closing report.** State:

- Each feature written, its slug, its document path, and its status
  transition (`— → [NEW]`, `[PLANNED] → [ITERATED]`, `[DONE] → [ITERATED]`,
  `[NEW] → [NEW]`).
- Every task flipped to `[STALE]` by PHASE 0b, with its ID and title.
- The reconciliation command for each affected feature:
  `/task-add feature=<slug>`.
- Every open question recorded in the documents.
- Whether an interrupted-session marker was found at PHASE 0 and how it was
  resolved (resumed or started fresh), and that each written feature's
  marker was cleared in PHASE 3.
- If the council was convened: the question, the run SHA, the verdict, and
  the paths of the report and transcript it wrote, so the user can keep or
  delete them. Say nothing at all when it was not convened.
- When `WRITTEN` is non-empty and `--no-commit` was passed: an explicit
  reminder that nothing was committed.

---

COMMIT AND PUSH (unless `--no-commit` was passed)

If COMMIT is false (`--no-commit` was passed), run no git/VCS command at
all.

If COMMIT is true (the default; the pull-at-start from PHASE 0 already
ran):

1. If `WRITTEN` is empty, make no commit (and no push). Say so and stop.
2. Stage EXACTLY the paths in `WRITTEN` — the feature documents,
   `.claude/FEATURES.md`, `.claude/domain/INDEX.md`,
   `.claude/domain/product-design.md` if updated,
   `.claude/TASKS.md` when PHASE 0b flipped statuses, and a
   `.architect-progress.md` marker if PHASE 3 deleted a previously-committed
   one — and commit once:

   ```
   git add -- <path1> <path2> ...
   git commit -m "Architect <feature slug(s)>"
   ```

   Never use `git add -A`, `git add .`, or `git add -u`. On a non-git VCS,
   use the project's `## VCS` mapping in CLAUDE.md (git→`cm`).
3. On commit success, report the commit hash (`git rev-parse --short
   HEAD`). Then, unless NO_PUSH is true or the non-git VCS exemption
   applies, re-sync with `git pull` immediately before pushing — other
   commits may have landed upstream during the run — then `git push`.
4. On commit failure (e.g. a pre-commit hook rejects the commit): surface
   the exact output. Do NOT retry, amend, or use `--no-verify` /
   `--no-gpg-sign`. Files remain staged but uncommitted; tell the user.
5. On push failure (rejected, no upstream, no remote) or a pre-push
   conflict: surface the exact output. Never retry, never force-push. The
   commit exists locally; tell the user it needs a manual sync + push.

Never branch, tag, or use `--amend` or a hook-skipping flag (`--no-verify`,
`--no-gpg-sign`).

---

DO NOT:
- Write any file before PHASE 3, with exactly two exceptions:
  - the PHASE 2 progress marker
    (`.claude/domain/features/<target-slug>.architect-progress.md`);
  - the report and transcript claude-council writes for itself when the
    PHASE 2 council gate is convened (`council-report-*.html`,
    `council-transcript-*.md` — see `./council-gate.md`). This carve-out is
    narrow: it permits those two files and nothing else, and neither ever
    enters `WRITTEN` or a staging list.

  Everything else — feature documents, `FEATURES.md`, `INDEX.md`,
  `product-design.md` — is PHASE 3's job. On the amend path PHASE 3 never
  runs, and `./amend.md` § 5 is the write step instead.
