description: 'Suggest capturing the follow-up actions of a conversation as a runbook, before the session that produced them closes. Trigger whenever a conversation produces an ordered list of follow-up actions for later sessions — the tail of an /architect or /product-design run, a "next steps" list, "do these in order" — and there are three or more actions, or two with an ordering constraint, or any that depends on a decision written down nowhere but this conversation. Emits one or two lines naming /runbook-create and stops. Not for: a single action; things already done; a checklist this session will work through itself; an enumeration inside an explanation; a two-step list of simple prompts; tasks that belong in the backlog, which is /task-add; or a reply to a Follow-ups list, which follow-ups-resolve owns.'

# /runbook-suggest
# Global skill: when a conversation ends with an ordered list of follow-up
# actions meant for later sessions, say once that /runbook-create can capture
# them. Not invoked by the user — selected from the description above. Asks
# nothing, reads nothing, writes nothing, and creates no runbook.

**The description is the mechanism.** Claude Code picks a skill from its
`description`, so there is no hook, no `Stop` handler and no event
registration anywhere in this feature — the frontmatter above is the whole
trigger, and it carries both the conditions and the anti-triggers.

**The threshold.** Suggest only when the follow-ups would be *lost with the
conversation*: three or more actions, or two or more with an ordering
constraint, or any action that depends on decisions recorded nowhere on
disk. Never for a two-step list of simple prompts.

**Not this.** A single next action. A list of things already done. A
checklist this session is about to work through itself. An enumeration
inside an explanation. A list of tasks that belongs in the backlog — that is
`/task-add`'s job, not a runbook's. A user reply to a Follow-ups list — that
is the `follow-ups-resolve` skill's.

**Emit one or two lines, then stop.** Say that `/runbook-create` will turn
these follow-ups into a runbook, or append them to one that already exists.
Name no runbook, do not say which runbooks exist, and do not say whether one
is running: `/runbook-create` with no arguments is what asks
new-versus-append and lists the choices, and that gate belongs to the
command the user chose to run.

**Ask nothing.** No question, no gate, no waiting — a question from a skill
that fired on a guess is an interruption at exactly the wrong moment. Open
no file: not `.claude/RUNBOOKS.md`, not a runbook body, nothing. Write
nothing, create nothing, and never invoke `/runbook-create` yourself.
Propose once per conversation; if the user says nothing, that is the answer.

**Fire rate is tuned after observing real sessions.** That is this skill's
method, not an open question — the threshold above cannot be settled on
paper. If it proves noisy, the fix is a narrower description, never a
suppression flag.
