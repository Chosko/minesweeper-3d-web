# The inline contract

Fixed text. Under `/runbook-run --inline`, the session executing a step
follows the rule set below **in place of** the subagent contract's OPERATING
RULES (`subagent-contract.md`).

- Read it once per run, in loop step 1, and **only when `--inline` is
  passed** — a default run never loads this file.
- Never re-word it per step: under `--inline` the session is both bound by the
  rules and tempted to relax them.
- Three placeholders, as in the subagent contract: the runbook's name
  (`<RUNBOOK>`), the step being executed (`<N>`) and the body's path as its
  index block's `File:` line holds it (`<FILE>`).

## INLINE RULES

```
INLINE RULES

- You are executing step <N> of runbook <RUNBOOK>, in this session, under
  --inline. This is the execution phase: it ends when you write out your
  outcome, and not before.
- Assemble the same brief a spawned step prompt carries — the preamble, the
  Companion: background, ## Do not re-propose, the step's Context:, and the
  step's prompt block verbatim — and work through it in that order.
- The brief is the authority. What you remember of an earlier step is not an
  instruction.
- Records win. Where your memory of an earlier step disagrees with that step's
  Done: line or a Context: bullet, the record is right.
- Facts are still written down. When this step changes a fact a later step
  relies on, it is propagated into that later step's Context: in the
  bookkeeping phase, exactly as in spawned mode, even though you already know
  it.
- At any clarifying question or approval gate: if you are a top-level session,
  ask the user directly in the fixed block
  `Step <N> of <total> — <title> — asking (round <r>)`, with a plain summary
  of any gate draft, the full draft only on `show`. Never answer your own
  question, and never skip a gate because you "already know" the answer —
  except that under an unattended run a gate the invoked skill tags
  `confirmation` passes on its own, as that skill says, and is not a skipped
  gate. If you are yourself a subagent,
  end your turn under `QUESTIONS FOR USER` instead, as in the default mode.
- One prompt is the exception: the dirty-tree prompt (`Working tree has
  uncommitted changes. Choose:`) a step's command puts before it starts. When
  the only uncommitted changes it lists are <FILE> and .claude/RUNBOOKS.md —
  the runbook and the index the run marked in-flight — answer `1` / `proceed`
  yourself, print the one line
  `dirty-tree prompt answered proceed — only runbook WIP is dirty`, and carry
  on. Never `include`: those two files must not ride in the step's commit. If
  anything else is dirty, put the prompt to the user unchanged.
- Two rules hold only when the run's policy is unattended — the brief's
  preamble says so; under an attended run neither applies. First: at a
  question you would otherwise ask, leave the working tree clean of your own
  changes — work a skill you invoked has parked on a branch is not yours and
  stays where it is — say so, and end the execution phase with the question
  as your outcome, for the fifth result row to park. Second: a `Context:`
  bullet opening `unparked with answer:` answers the question the invoked
  skill asks — a pre-ask, a prompt, a gate — so answer it from there, at
  whatever point the skill asks it, and never put it to the user again.
- Follow the invoked skill's default commit behaviour. Add no flag the user did
  not type.
- If the work wants a child subagent, spawn it directly, one level down. If you
  cannot spawn, follow your own parent's contract (for example SPAWN REQUEST).
  Failing that, the step fails [!] with a Done: line naming the child that could
  not be spawned and saying that re-running the step without --inline is the
  fix. Never do a child's work in your own context.
- During the execution phase, never edit <FILE> or .claude/RUNBOOKS.md.
- End the execution phase by writing out your outcome as a separate act, before
  any bookkeeping: the literal line `DONE` followed by the commit sha(s) and
  their diffstat, plus any decision or wrong premise a later reader of this
  runbook would be misled without — or, if the work failed or
  could not be completed, a plain statement of failure. If you cannot state the
  outcome confidently, it is a failure.
- The Stop-hook reply is unchanged.
```

## Rules end

## Why each rule is in there

Not part of the rule set — for whoever maintains the contract.

- **The phase boundary.** In the default mode a second agent separates the one
  who does the work from the one who records it. Under `--inline` only the
  phase boundary is left, so the rule names where the execution phase ends: at
  a written outcome.
- **The same brief, in order.** A runbook stays executable by either mode
  without re-authoring; only *who executes* changes.
- **The brief is the authority / records win.** A fresh subagent cannot carry
  a half-decision from step 1 into step 4; an inline session can. These two
  rules replace that structural guarantee.
- **Facts are still written down.** A resumed or spawned run of the same
  runbook does not share the session's memory, and "records win" only works
  if the record exists.
- **Asking directly.** There is no relay hop, because the asker and the user's
  interlocutor are the same agent. A session that answers its own question,
  or skips a gate it thinks it can predict, has made a decision the user never
  made. A `confirmation` gate passing on its own under `unattended` is not
  that: the gate's owner declared the decision already made. The fixed block
  tells the user which step is asking.
- **The dirty-tree prompt answers itself.** A step's `/task-implement` runs in
  the session that set `[~]` and `[RUNNING]` one moment earlier, so its
  pre-flight check meets them. The condition mirrors SKILL.md's Stop-hook
  reply, with the same fall-through: anything else dirty still reaches the
  user. `proceed`, never `include`, because folding the markers into the
  task's commit would commit the in-flight state COMMIT CADENCE forbids. The
  rule is word for word the subagent contract's, and lives in the two
  contracts rather than in `task-engine`'s `tree.md`: the runbook side answers
  its own prompt, and `/task-implement` learns nothing about runbooks.
- **The two unattended rules.** The subagent contract's two, in the inline
  session's register: there is no turn to end, so the question becomes the
  execution phase's written outcome, which step 7 parks by the fifth result
  row. The tree is left clean because the next step runs in this same
  session; the answer is read from `Context:` because the step re-runs whole
  and the invoked skill asks again.
- **Children one level down, never inline.** Under `--inline` the level a
  step's agent occupied is free, so a wanted child goes there. Doing a child's
  work in the session destroys the fresh context that was the reason for a
  child. When no level is reachable, failing the step and naming the default
  mode as the fix is honest; improvising is not.
- **Never edit the runbook or the index during execution.** The bookkeeping
  phase writes exactly those two files; mixing the phases is how a `Done:`
  line gets written for work that did not finish.
- **The written outcome.** The inline analogue of waiting for a spawn's
  result. Classifying on a written statement — never on a re-inspection of the
  session's own diff — keeps the orchestrator from reviewing.
