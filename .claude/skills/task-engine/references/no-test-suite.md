# No-test-suite mode

Read this when the project has no test suite at all (no test runner
detectable AND no test directory like `tests/`, `test/`, `__tests__/`,
`spec/`), or when CLAUDE.md declares a `skip-tests` testing policy. The
tests-first flow cannot run; switch to interactive mode.

0. **If `CLAUDE.md` carries `Testing policy for /task-implement:
   skip-tests` or `skip-tests-unattended`** (see `./testing-policy.md`
   step 0), skip step 1's A/B question entirely. Tell the user once,
   briefly: "This project's CLAUDE.md declares a skip-tests testing
   policy — implementing without tests." (For `skip-tests-unattended`,
   AUTO_CONFIRM is already true per step 0 — add ", unattended (no
   per-task confirmation)" to that same sentence.) Go straight to step 3
   (skip-tests mode).

1. Otherwise, tell the user once, up front:

   > This project has no detectable test suite. Without tests, I can't
   > follow the tests-first sequence (write test → implement → watch it
   > pass). Two options:
   >
   > A. **Set up a test suite now.** I can scaffold one for the project's
   >    language (e.g. pytest for Python, Jest for JS) — installing the
   >    dev dependency, adding a config, and creating a `tests/` directory.
   >    From then on, the run uses full test mode.
   >
   > B. **Skip test phases.** I'll implement each change without writing or
   >    running tests. Each still gets its own commit, but I'll ask you to
   >    confirm before starting each one — without tests, I can't
   >    self-verify the implementation, so a human review point is
   >    important.
   >
   > Which would you like?

   Suggest option A only when scaffolding is genuinely straightforward for
   the language at hand. If the project's language has no obvious default
   test framework, mention that and let the user direct.

   Under the `unattended` policy this is a real decision with nothing yet to
   park, so the run stops here with the question, per
   `../../interaction-engine/references/gates.md` § *Real decisions*.

2. Do as the user tells. If they pick A, scaffold the suite first (in its
   own commit, separate from any change), then proceed in full test mode.
   If they pick B, proceed in skip-tests mode.

3. **Skip-tests mode** for the rest of the run:
   - Unless AUTO_CONFIRM is true (a `-y` flag or a `skip-tests-unattended`
     policy marker), before each unit of work briefly summarize what you're
     about to change and ask "Proceed?" Wait for explicit approval before
     editing any file. When AUTO_CONFIRM is true, skip this prompt — state
     the one-line summary anyway so the user can see what's about to happen,
     then proceed without waiting. Gate class: `confirmation`
     (`../../interaction-engine/references/gates.md`) — under the
     `unattended` policy the prompt passes on its own and is one *For the
     record* line; the one-line summary is still stated.
   - Skip Steps 2, 4 and 5 of `./tests-first.md` (anything test-related).
     Step 3 still runs, and so does every step of the consumer's own.
   - The commit message should note "(no tests — manual verification
     pending)" in the body so it's visible later.

Never auto-scaffold a test suite without the user explicitly choosing
option A.

## Per-consumer notes

- **`/task-implement`** — the unit of work is a task: the "Proceed?" prompt
  comes before each task (BETWEEN TASKS step 4), and its Steps 1, 6 and 7
  still run. The `all` argument still works in skip-tests mode, but the
  per-task confirmation prompts still apply (one per task) unless
  AUTO_CONFIRM or UNATTENDED is true. AUTO_CONFIRM is set by its `-y` flag.
