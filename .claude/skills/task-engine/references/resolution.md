# Backlog resolution

Authority for: where the backlog lives, what a summary block holds, when a
per-task body file may be opened, where a task goes when it leaves the
backlog and what an id absent from the index means, how a run resolves
which tasks it operates on, and the eligibility clause — status plus
`Preconditions:` — that the batch selectors honour.

Extracted verbatim from the `LOCATING THE BACKLOG` sections of
`/task-list`, `/task-clean` and `/task-implement`, from `/task-add`'s
`PHASE 0 — SETUP CHECK` and `INDEX FILE FORMAT`, and from
`/task-implement`'s `ARGUMENT PARSING` selectors. § *The archive* and the
`[PARKED]` clauses are the exceptions: authored here, and no consumer ever
carried a copy of them.

---

## Where the backlog lives

The backlog index lives at `.claude/TASKS.md`. Per-task body content
lives at `.claude/tasks/<N>.md` — one file per task ID.

## Index file format (`.claude/TASKS.md`)

```
# Tasks

Last task number: <N>

---

## <N>. <Title>

Status: [MISSING]
Target: claude
Files: <comma-separated list>
Preconditions: <comma-separated task numbers, or "none">
Feature: <slug>          ← optional; only on feature-derived tasks

---
```

The summary block holds: number, title, Status, Target, Files,
Preconditions, and — only when the task was generated from a feature
document — `Feature:`. Nothing else. Description and decisions live in the
body.

`Feature:` carries the slug of the feature the task came from. It is
present ONLY on feature-derived tasks and is absent entirely on free-form
ones — do not write `Feature: none`. Like `Status:` and `Preconditions:`,
it is backlog metadata, so it lives in the summary block and never in the
body file.

`Last task number: N` tracks the highest ID ever assigned, not the highest
currently present, and only ever increases. Task IDs are stable: survivors
of a prune are never renumbered and a pruned ID is never reused.

Appearance order in the file is the backlog's order, and it need not be
numeric. `/task-add --before <N>` / `--after <N>` write a new block mid-file
under the next ID from the counter, exactly as an append would, so a higher
ID may sit above a lower one. No existing ID ever moves or changes. Read
order from position, never from the number.

## When the backlog is not initialised

If `.claude/TASKS.md` does not exist, tell the user so, name `/task-setup`,
and stop. Do NOT create anything — no index file, no `.claude/tasks/`
directory.

`/task-add` probes for both required artifacts rather than just the index:

> **PHASE 0 — SETUP CHECK (must pass before anything else)**
>
> Before reading anything else, verify the backlog has been initialized.
> The required artifacts are:
> 1. `.claude/TASKS.md` — the index file.
> 2. `.claude/tasks/` — the per-task body directory.
>
> Probe with the Read tool / Glob. If either is missing, stop:
>
> > The task backlog hasn't been initialized in this project. Run
> > `/task-setup` first — it creates `.claude/TASKS.md` and the
> > `.claude/tasks/` directory. Then re-run `/task-add`.
>
> Do not proceed to PHASE 1. This rule has no exceptions.

## Parsing the index

Read `.claude/TASKS.md` with the Read tool and parse:

- The `Last task number: N` header value.
- Each summary block. Extract:
  - Number (from the `## N. Title` line)
  - Title (the text after `N.`)
  - Status (the value on the `Status:` line, including its brackets)
  - Target (the value on the `Target:` line; treat a missing line
    as `claude`)
  - Preconditions (the value on the `Preconditions:` line)
  - Feature (the value on the `Feature:` line, when the block has
    one; feature-derived tasks only, so a missing line is normal
    and means "free-form task")

`Files:` is on the summary block too, and is read by the features that need
it.

## Opening a per-task body file

Read TASKS.md first to find the summary block for each requested task
(number, title, Status, Files, Preconditions). For each task you are
about to implement, read its `.claude/tasks/<N>.md` body file when you
need its spec — not before. Do NOT bulk-read every body file up front:
open each one only at the moment its task becomes the current one. If the
body file for a task you intend to implement is missing, stop and report
— the task is corrupt and the user should investigate.

A body is read on this path, never written. The one section
`/task-implement` writes in a body is the trailing `## Parking handoff` of
`./parking.md`, appended at a park and removed at the unpark.

This section governs live bodies only — the `.claude/tasks/<N>.md` paths.
Nothing in it opens a file under `.claude/tasks/archive/`; a file there
falls under § *The archive* instead.

## The archive

A task that leaves the backlog is archived, not deleted. Its body lives at
`.claude/tasks/archive/<N>.md`, the task's id as the file name exactly as
the live body had it. The folder is created by the first run that archives
a task into it, and it is append-only: the archiving run is its only
writer, and nothing removes a file from it or rewrites one in it.

An archived file is the original body, unchanged, plus a frozen header
directly under the title, written as the same `Key: value` lines the body
already uses for `Target:`:

```
# Task 12 — <title>

Archived: 2026-09-11
Status: [DONE]
Files: <as the summary block had it>
Preconditions: <as the summary block had it>
Feature: <slug>          ← only when the task had one

Target: claude

## Goal
…
```

`Archived:` is the date the task left the backlog, as `YYYY-MM-DD`. Every
other line is copied from the task's summary block as it stood at that
moment — `Preconditions:` included, which may itself name archived ids.
Nothing else is derived or added, and the header is written once and never
updated.

**The rule.** An id referenced anywhere but absent from `TASKS.md` is
archived and terminal; no command probes the folder, opens an archived
file, or reports on its contents, except when the user names a task and
asks to read it.

Absence is the whole signal. No reader verifies that the archived file is
there, so a hand-deleted body is indistinguishable from an archived one —
by design. The difference surfaces only when the user asks to read the
task, and at that point a missing file says so itself.

## Where a status flip is written

Status flips happen in `.claude/TASKS.md` only — the per-task body
file does not store Status, Files, or Preconditions, so do not edit
the body file when changing status. The `[PARKED]` flip is the one that
touches the body as well: it writes the `## Parking handoff` beside the
flip, and the unpark removes it — `./parking.md`. The status itself still
lives in `.claude/TASKS.md` alone.

## Selectors

A run's task list resolves from its argument to one of:

- A whitespace-separated list of task numbers — implement those tasks in
  the order given. Explicit-list selection is unchanged by the eligibility
  clause below: **a task requested by number is never blocked by a
  precondition.** The user who names a task has already chosen its moment;
  the clause governs only the two batch selectors.
- The literal token `next` (case-insensitive) — the first task in the
  backlog, by appearance order in TASKS.md, that is **eligible** (below);
  implement that single task. Report "Next eligible task: <N> — <title>" and
  proceed without asking for confirmation. If no task is eligible, stop
  with whichever of these is true:
  - no implementable task exists at all — "No eligible tasks found — all
    tasks are DONE, SKIP, IN PROGRESS, STALE, or PARKED with no answer.";
  - implementable tasks exist, but every one of them is blocked — "No
    eligible tasks found — every implementable task is waiting on an unmet
    precondition: 14 (waits on 12), 15 (waits on 14)." Name every blocked
    task by id with the ids it waits on; never claim the backlog is
    finished when the only reason nothing is eligible is an unmet
    precondition.
- The literal token `all` (case-insensitive) — `next` applied repeatedly
  until no task is eligible, which keeps a batch from starting a task ahead
  of one it waits on without a second definition of eligibility. It is
  resolved **once, up front**, by simulating that repetition rather than
  re-resolving after every task: walk the backlog from the top and select
  the first eligible task not yet selected; from then on treat it as
  `[DONE]`, so it satisfies every precondition that names it and is never
  selected again; walk again from the top; stop when a walk selects
  nothing. The selections, in the order made, are the run's fixed list — the
  same list repeated `next` would yield — so the run still gets one
  resolution report and one delegation count. Report it as a one-line
  summary ("Will implement: 3, 7, 12 (5 tasks skipped: 1 DONE, 1 IN
  PROGRESS, 3 SKIP)") and proceed without asking for confirmation — the
  user already chose `all`. If the list comes out empty, stop with the same
  message `next` would give.

### Eligibility

A task is **eligible** only when both hold:

1. its status is implementable — `[MISSING]`, `[STUBBED]`, `[INCORRECT]` or
   `[PARTIAL]`, or `[PARKED]` exactly when an answerer exists
   (`./parking.md` § *The answerer rule*): an attended session, or an
   `unattended` run holding an answer for it. A `[PARKED]` task with no
   answerer is skipped with one line, never re-parked. Tasks whose status
   is `[DONE]`, `[SKIP]`, `[IN PROGRESS]` or `[STALE]` are skipped by both
   batch selectors;
2. every id on its `Preconditions:` line resolves to a task whose status is
   `[DONE]` or `[SKIP]`. `Preconditions: none` satisfies this trivially. An
   id that resolves to no summary block in TASKS.md is ignored, never a
   blocker — the same tolerance the suite already extends to a hand-edited
   or pruned backlog wherever an id resolves to nothing.

An implementable task that fails clause 2 is **blocked**. Eligibility is
derived on every read and stored nowhere; `Preconditions:` keeps its shape
and becomes load-bearing rather than informational.

**The blocked report.** The `all` resolution report names, by id, every
implementable task left unselected because a precondition is unmet, each
with the ids it waits on — "Blocked by unmet preconditions: 14 (waits on
12), 21 (waits on 20)." — so an unsatisfiable edge is visible rather than
silently skipped. Omit the line when nothing is blocked.

**A precondition cycle** — 20 waits on 21, 21 waits on 20, or any longer
loop — makes every task on it ineligible, and every task waiting on one of
them as well: none of them can ever satisfy clause 2. The resolution still
terminates, because each walk either selects a task not selected before or
ends the resolution, and the tasks are finite. The cycle's tasks appear in
the blocked report like any other blocked task, each naming the ids it
waits on, which is what lets a reader see the loop.

`[STALE]` tasks are skipped by `all` and `next` because each one needs a
per-task judgment call and a batch run should not stop to ask — see
`./stale.md`.
When the resolved list skips any, name them: "Skipped N stale task(s): 12,
14 — implement them explicitly by number to decide each one." A stale task
requested explicitly by number is not skipped.

For `all` and `next`, after resolving the list, check each resolved task's
`Target:` field in its TASKS.md summary block and warn when the run will
need the user present — see
`./targets.md`.

Which statuses a resolved task may carry, and what to do when an explicitly
requested task carries another one, is
`./status.md`.

## Per-consumer notes

- **`/task-list`** — the not-initialised message is "No backlog file found.
  Run /task-setup to initialize it, then /task-add to create the first
  task." It performs no writes and needs no shell at all, and it must NOT
  open any file under `.claude/tasks/` — TASKS.md already contains
  everything `/task-list` needs. It takes no selector; its argument is a
  status filter (see `status.md`). When `.claude/PLAN.md` exists it also
  reads `.claude/PLAN.md` and `.claude/FEATURES.md`, read-only, for
  milestone grouping — that resolution is `/task-list`'s own and is not
  part of this file.
- **`/task-clean`** — the not-initialised message is "No backlog file found
  — run /task-setup to initialize it." It parses number, title, status,
  `Files:`, `Preconditions:` and `Feature:` from each summary block — the
  last three because the frozen header carries them — and it opens a
  per-task body file for a single reason: to probe that the file exists
  before planning its **move** into the archive, noting a missing one in
  the plan rather than erroring out. Beyond that it touches a body only to
  move it and write its frozen header. It is the archive's only writer, and
  so the one departure from § *The archive*'s read prohibition: it checks
  whether `.claude/tasks/archive/<N>.md` exists for each id it is about to
  write, and does nothing else there — no listing of the folder, no opening
  of a file already in it. A prune does not open `.claude/FEATURES.md` at
  all; the skill's only `FEATURES.md` write is the `Tasks:` restoration
  under `--backfill`. Its argument is a status set, not a selector (see
  `status.md`), or `--backfill`, never both. It also pulls at start before
  PHASE 1 — see `commit.md`.
- **`/task-implement`** — the not-initialised message is "No backlog file
  found — run /task-setup to initialize it, then /task-add to create
  tasks." The `all` / `next` / explicit-list selectors above are its
  argument form; it is the only consumer that has them. Its one departure
  is a re-check: between tasks of an `all` run it re-reads TASKS.md anyway,
  and there it re-checks the upcoming task's `Preconditions:` against clause
  2 of *Eligibility*, skipping with a one-line report a task whose
  preconditions no longer hold. It reads nothing new to do it. Its other
  departure is the pre-ask under `--unattended`: at pre-flight it opens each
  `[PARKED]` task's trailing `## Parking handoff`, that section only,
  because the question it lists verbatim lives nowhere else
  (`./parking.md`).
- **`/task-add`** — resolves nothing from the index but the next ID, the
  task a `--before <N>` / `--after <N>` flag names and, on a
  `feature=<slug>` run, the tasks that feature already generated. Its
  setup check is the two-artifact probe quoted above rather than the
  index-only check the other three make, and its pull-at-start sits in the
  same PHASE 0 — see `commit.md`. On a `feature=<slug>` run, its
  reconciliation leaves an id on the feature's `Tasks:` line that has no
  summary block unclassified — archived and terminal, per § *The archive*
  — and keeps that id when it rewrites the `Tasks:` line at the end of the
  run.
