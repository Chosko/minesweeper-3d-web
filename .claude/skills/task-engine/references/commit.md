# Commit and push gating

Authority for: the `--no-commit` / `--no-push` flags, pull-at-start, what
may be staged, how many commits a unit of work produces, and what happens
when a commit or a push fails.

Extracted verbatim from `/task-add`'s `ARGUMENT NOTE` and `PHASE 5 — COMMIT
AND PUSH`, `/task-clean`'s `ARGUMENT NOTE` and `PHASE 3 — COMMIT AND PUSH`,
and `/task-implement`'s `ARGUMENT PARSING`, `PRE-FLIGHT` step 5 and
`Step 7`.

## The flags

`--commit`: accepted and stripped, a silent no-op — committing is already
the default, so a bare `--commit` never reaches what the consumer parses
next.

`--no-commit`: skip committing (and pushing) entirely; the changes stay
uncommitted in the working tree. `--commit` and `--no-commit` are mutually
exclusive — if both appear, stop with:
`--commit and --no-commit cannot be combined. Pick one.` NO_COMMIT true
implies NO_PUSH true — nothing is committed to push.

`--no-push`: only matters when NO_COMMIT is false. It skips the
pull at start, the pre-push re-sync and the push of **The push protocol**
below while still committing as always.

Under `--no-commit`, report what was written or changed and remind the user
that nothing was committed — they should commit when ready. Do not run any
git command.

## Pull at start

Unless NO_COMMIT is true (nothing will be committed this run, so nothing to
push) or the project's CLAUDE.md carries a `## VCS` override (non-git — no
push step exists there either), run `git pull` on the current branch once,
right after the feature's own precondition/setup checks and before any of
its normal work begins. A conflict stops the run here — report the conflict
output and tell the user to resolve manually and re-run. This runs once per
invocation, not once per unit of work; each unit's own re-sync happens right
before its push.

## Staging

Stage ONLY the explicit paths this run wrote or changed, by path
(`git add -- <path> <path>`). Never use `git add -A`, `git add .`, or
`git add -u` — anything that could pull in unrelated dirty files from the
working tree.

Make no empty commit: if the run wrote nothing, commit nothing.

The one sanctioned use of `git add -u` is the dirty-tree fold, and only when
the user explicitly chose to include their pre-existing changes — see
`./tree.md`.

## One commit per unit of work

A run makes exactly one commit per unit of work — one task added, one prune,
one task implemented — even when several units were requested in the same
invocation, and never bundles two units into one commit.

Do NOT use `--no-verify`, `--amend`, `--no-gpg-sign`, or skip any hooks
unless the user explicitly asked for it. If a pre-commit hook fails,
investigate and fix the underlying issue, then create a NEW commit (do
not amend). Never branch or tag — the one exception is `/task-implement`'s
parking branch, `./parking.md`.

## The push protocol

Every command that commits (whether by default or under `--commit`) also
pushes, once it has actually committed something, in four steps:

1. **Pull at start**, as above.
2. Do the command's own work and commit exactly as already specified above.
3. **Pre-push re-sync.** Immediately before pushing, run `git pull` again —
   other commits may have landed upstream while the command was running. A
   clean fast-forward/merge: continue to push. A conflict: abort the merge,
   leave the local commit intact, do **not** push, and report that the
   commit exists locally but could not be synced — the user must resolve and
   push manually.
4. **Push.** `git push`. On failure (rejected, no upstream, no remote):
   report the exact output and stop. Never retry, never force-push.

On commit success, report the resulting commit hash to the user
(`git rev-parse --short HEAD`).

**Non-git VCS exemption.** When the project's CLAUDE.md defines a `## VCS`
section overriding git (e.g. Plastic SCM), skip the entire pull → re-sync →
push sequence unconditionally — only the commit (checkin) step runs.

## Failure

- **On commit failure** (e.g. a pre-commit hook rejects the commit):
  surface the exact failure output to the user. Do NOT retry, do NOT amend,
  do NOT use `--no-verify` or any hook-skipping flag. The files remain
  in whatever state git left them (typically staged but uncommitted);
  tell the user that and let them decide.
- **On push failure** (rejected, no upstream, no remote) or a pre-push
  conflict: surface the exact output. Never retry, never force-push. The
  commit exists locally; tell the user it needs a manual sync + push.

## Per-consumer notes

- **`/task-list`** — never commits and never shells out. It has neither
  flag: it is read-only by contract.
- **`/task-add`** — pulls at start inside `PHASE 0 — SETUP CHECK`; `PHASE 5`
  is "the only phase that shells out". Four commit-message forms, one
  commit each:
  - single task — `git add -- .claude/TASKS.md .claude/tasks/<N>.md` then
    `git commit -m "Add task <N>: <title>"`;
  - split — every file PHASE 4 wrote, ONE commit covering every task ID
    created, `git commit -m "Add tasks <N>-<N+k-1>: <short summary of the
    split>"`;
  - feature — additionally stage `.claude/FEATURES.md` plus the body file of
    every existing task the reconciliation rewrote,
    `git commit -m "Plan feature <slug>: tasks <N>-<M>"`. "The backlog
    change and the feature entry only make sense together, so they belong in
    one commit."
  - attached — `feature=<slug> --single`, or a free-form task the orphan
    question attached to a feature: the single-task (or split) paths plus
    `.claude/FEATURES.md`, whose `Tasks:` line the run wrote, under the
    single-task (or split) message. One attached task is not a planning
    pass, so it never takes the `Plan feature` message.

  A `--before <N>` run's edit to task N's `Preconditions:` line lives in
  `.claude/TASKS.md`, which every form already stages.
- **`/task-clean`** — pulls at start before PHASE 1; `PHASE 3` commits with
  `git commit -m "task-clean: archive tasks <N>[, <M>, …]"`, the archived IDs
  in ascending order. Both halves of each move are already in the index by
  then: PHASE 2's `git mv` stages the removal of `.claude/tasks/<N>.md` and
  the addition of `.claude/tasks/archive/<N>.md` together, which is what
  records the move as a rename. PHASE 3 therefore stages `.claude/TASKS.md`
  plus each `.claude/tasks/archive/<N>.md` — picking up the frozen header
  written after the move — and never names the old path, which by then
  exists in neither the working tree nor the index and would make
  `git add` fail. A body moved with a plain `mv` has no old half to stage.
  `.claude/FEATURES.md` never joins a prune's paths: a prune does not open
  it. Apart from the `mkdir -p` + `git mv` of the body
  files in PHASE 2 — which replace the old `rm`, and which still run under
  `--no-commit`, because the move is the prune's effect rather than a commit
  step — and the park-branch sweep's listing and deletes, PHASE 3 is its
  only shell use. The sweep's local listing and deletes are its effect too
  and run under `--no-commit`; its remote listing
  (`git ls-remote`) and deletes (`git push origin --delete`) are remote
  operations and are skipped under NO_PUSH, which `--no-commit` implies. A
  branch delete changes no tracked file, so it adds nothing to the commit
  and a run that only sweeps makes none.

  Under `--backfill` it commits once, with
  `git commit -m "task-clean: backfill <N> archived tasks"`, `<N>` being the
  count of bodies recovered. It stages each `.claude/tasks/archive/<N>.md`
  it wrote, plus `.claude/FEATURES.md` when a feature `Tasks:` line was
  restored — the one path on which `.claude/FEATURES.md` joins
  `/task-clean`'s staged paths. Its reads of git history (`git log`,
  `git show`), PHASE B2's `mkdir -p` and the redirected
  `git show … > .claude/tasks/archive/<N>.md` write are that mode's own shell
  use beside PHASE 3, and they still run under `--no-commit` — like the
  prune's move, they are the mode's effect, not a commit step.
- **`/task-implement`** — pulls at start in `PRE-FLIGHT` step 5; `Step 7`
  commits and pushes once per task, "immediately after that task's commit,
  mirroring 'each task gets exactly one commit' with 'each task gets exactly
  one push.'" Never defer a task's push to end-of-run. Its message format
  "follows the repo's existing style — read the last few `git log` entries
  first", falling back to:

  ```
  Task <N>: <task title>

  <optional body — at most 2–3 lines, and only when it says something the
  subject line cannot>
  ```

  The body is optional and capped at 2–3 lines; on a small task, omit it
  entirely rather than restating the diff. In skip-tests mode it appends
  `(no tests — manual verification pending)`: to the body when there is one,
  otherwise as the body's only line.

  Staging is by explicit path including the `.claude/TASKS.md` status flip;
  the per-task body file "is typically NOT modified during implementation —
  do not include it in the commit unless you genuinely changed it". When
  DIRTY_FOLD is true it folds instead, per `tree.md`.
  Two departures from the one-commit rule are deliberate and are its own:
  - under `--review`, "the loop's fixes are already in the tree and are
    staged as part of this task's own commit, never as a second one", and
    `/task-iterate` commits nothing inside a round;
  - the `FEATURE COMPLETION` flip is "separate from, and in addition to, the
    per-task commits already made" — exactly ONE commit covering every flip
    approved in the run, `Mark feature(s) <slug>[, <slug> …] [DONE]`, pushed
    the same way.

  Two more are `./parking.md`'s, under the `unattended` policy:
  - a park makes two commits — `Task <N>: parked work-in-progress` on the
    branch `park/task-<N>` (the task's tracked edits and created files,
    minus `.claude/TASKS.md` and `.claude/tasks/<N>.md`), then
    `Task <N>: parked — <reason>` on the base, staging exactly those two
    backlog files; the same bookkeeping form records the `Answer:` of an
    unpark whose merge failed;
  - an unpark makes no commit of its own: the `[IN PROGRESS]` flip and the
    handoff's removal ride in the task's own commit, which is the one path
    on which the per-task body file is staged. The parking branch is
    deleted after that commit and its push, best-effort — `./parking.md`
    § *The unpark transaction*.

  A `Step 7` push failure or pre-push conflict is distinct from any other
  failure: the commit already succeeded, so do not revert it or flip the
  status back — stop the run and report that the commit exists locally and
  needs a manual sync + push.
